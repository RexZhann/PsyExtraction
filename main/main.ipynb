       "  'the symptoms and pathologies of mental disorders appear to be, in contrast, highly responsive to a wide variety of neurochemical, interpersonal, cognitive, and other mediating and moderating variables that help to develop, shape, and form a particular individual’s psychopathology profile (andreasen, 1997; rutter, 2003; tsuang et al., 2000).

       "  'a dimensional classification of mental disorders might be viewed by some as a radical departure, but dsm–iv already includes a strong precedent. ',\n",
       "  'the point of demarcation for the diagnosis of mental retardation is an arbitrary, quantitative distinction along the normally distributed levels of hierarchically and multifactorially defined intelligence. ',\n",
       "  'the current point of demarcation is an iq of 70, along with a clinically significant level of impairment. ',\n",
       "  'this point of demarcation is arbitrary in the sense that it does not carve nature at a discrete joint, but it was not randomly or mindlessly chosen (haslam, 2002). ',\n",

       "  'the dsm–iv classification of maladaptive levels of intelligence is also a useful model because it illustrates how categorical and dimensional diagnoses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. ',\n",

       "  'on the other hand, the categorical diagnoses in the case of mental retardation are generally placed on axis iii as physical disorders (e.g., down’s syndrome) that can be traced to a specific biological event (i.e., trisomy 21), and the mental retardation of persons with these categorically distinct disorders is still described well in terms of the continuously distributed cognitive impairments. ',\n",
       "  'a general factor of intelligence (ability to reason, plan, solve, learn, and comprehend information) saturates most to all measures of cognitive ability (as a temperament of neuroticism might be common to many anxiety disorders), but it can in turn be further differentiated with respect to particular facets (e.g., quantitative, spatial, and verbal intelligence) that can themselves be in turn further differentiated into more specific components (lubinski, 2004). ',\n",
       "  'the domain of intelligence is distributed as a hierarchical, multifactorial continuous variable, as most persons’ level of intelligence, including most of those with mental retardation, is the result of a complex interaction of multiple genetic, fetal and infant development, and environmental influences (lubinski, 2004; neisser et al., 1996).

       "  'l. spitzer, chairperson task force on nomenclature and statistics american psychiatric association this is the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders of the american psychiatric association, better known simply as dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'the development of this manual over the last five years has not gone unnoticed; in fact, it is remarkable how much interest (alarm, despair, excitement, joy) has been shown in successive drafts of this document. ',\n",
       "  'the reasons for this interest are many. ',\n",
       "  'first of all, over the last decade there has been growing recognition of the importance of diagnosis for both clinical practice and research. ',\n",
       "  'clinicians and research investigators must have a common language with which to communicate about the disorders for which they have professional responsibility. ',\n",
       "  'planning a treatment program must begin with an accurate diagnostic assessment. ',\n",
       "  'the efficacy of various treatment modalities can be compared only if patient groups are described using diagnostic terms that are clearly defined. ',\n",
       "  'secondly, from its very beginning, drafts of dsm-iii have been widely circulated for critical review and use by clinicians and investigators. ',\n",
       "  'this made them aware of the many fundamental ways in which dsm-iii differs from its predecessor, dsm-ii, and from its international contemporary, the mental disorders chapter of the ninth revision of the international classification of diseases (icd-9). ',\n",
       "  'for example, dsm-iii includes such new features as diagnostic criteria, a multiaxial approach to evaluation, much-expanded descriptions of the disorders and many additional categories (some with newly-coined names); and it does not include several time-honored categories. ',\n",
       "  'finally, interest in the development of this manual is due to awareness that dsm-iii reflects an increased commitment in our field to reliance on data as the basis for understanding mental disorders. ',\n",
       "  \"background* the first edition of the american psychiatric association's diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders appeared in 1952. \",\n",
       "  'this was the first official manual of mental disorders to contain a glossary of descriptions of the diagnostic categories. ',\n",
       "  'the use of the term \"reaction\" throughout the classification reflected the influence of adolf meyer\\'s psychobiological view that mental disorders represented reactions of the personality to psychological, social, and biological factors. ',\n",
       "  'in the development of the second edition (dsm-ii), a decision was made to base the classification on the mental disorders section of the eighth revision of the international classification of diseases, for which representatives of the american psychiatric association had provided consultation. ',\n",
       "  'both dsm-ii and * some readers may wish, for now, to skip background and the process of development of dsm-iii and plunge directly into basic concepts on p.5. ',\n",
       "  'introduction 1 2  introduction icd-8 went into effect in 1968. ',\n",
       "  'the dsm-ii classification did not use the term \"reaction\" and used diagnostic terms that by and large did not imply a particular theoretical framework for understanding the nonorganic mental disorders. ',\n",
       "  'in 1974 the american psychiatric association, through its council on research and development, appointed a task force on nomenclature and statistics to begin work on the development of dsm-iii, recognizing that icd-9 was scheduled to go into effect in january 1979. ',\n",
       "  'by the time this new task force was constituted, the mental disorders section of icd-9, which included its own glossary, was nearly completed. ',\n",
       "  'although representatives of the american psychiatric association had worked closely with the world health organization in the development of icd-9, there was some concern that the icd-9 classification and glossary would not be suitable for use in the united states. ',\n",
       "  'most importantly, many specific areas of the classification did not seem sufficiently detailed for clinical and research use. ',\n",
       "  'for example, the icd-9 classification contains only one category for \"frigidity and impotence\"—despite the substantial work in the area of psychosexual dysfunctions that has identified several specific types with different clinical pictures and treatment implications. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, the glossary of icd-9 was believed by many to be less than optimal in that it had not made use of such recent major methodological developments as specified diagnostic criteria and the multiaxial approach to evaluation. ',\n",
       "  'for these reasons the task force was directed to prepare a new classification and glossary that would, as much as possible, reflect the most current state of knowledge regarding mental disorders while maintaining compatibility with icd-9. ',\n",
       "  'like its predecessors, dsm-i and dsm-ii, dsm-iii had to be, first of all, clinically useful, while also providing a basis for research and administrative use. ',\n",
       "  'the task force. ',\n",
       "  'task force members, and consultants from the fields of psychology and epidemiology, were selected because of their special interest in various aspects of diagnosis. ',\n",
       "  'most had made significant contributions to the literature on diagnosis. ',\n",
       "  'as the work progressed, additional members were added to ensure representation of different perspectives and areas of expertise. ',\n",
       "  'from the beginning, the task force functioned as a steering committee to oversee the ongoing work. ',\n",
       "  'all of its members shared a commitment to the attainment in dsm-iii of the following goals: —clinical usefulness for making treatment and management decisions in varied clinical settings; —reliability of the diagnostic categories; —acceptability to clinicians and researchers of varying theoretical orientations; —usefulness for educating health professionals; —maintaining compatibility with icd-9, except when departures are unavoidable; —avoiding the introduction of new terminology and concepts that break with tradition, except when clearly needed; —reaching consensus on the meaning of necessary diagnostic terms that have been used inconsistently, and avoiding the use of terms that have outlived their usefulness; —consistency with data from research studies bearing on the validity of diagnostic categories; introduction  3 —suitability for describing subjects in research studies; —being responsive during the development of dsm-iii to critiques by clinicians and researchers. ',\n",
       "  'the major job of the task force has been to determine the most effective strategies for ensuring that the final document attained each goal to as great an extent as possible without compromising the other goals. ',\n",
       "  'thus, the task force evaluated all proposals for changes in dsm-iii that might affect the attainment of these goals. ',\n",
       "  'these proposals came from members of the task force, advisory committees, liaison committees with professional organizations, and participants in the dsm-iii field trials. ',\n",
       "  'finally, the task force reviewed drafts of the text and diagnostic criteria. ',\n",
       "  'in attempting to resolve various diagnostic issues, the task force relied, as much as possible, on research evidence relevant to various kinds of diagnostic validity. ',\n",
       "  'for example, when discussing a problematic diagnostic category, the task force considered how the disorder, if defined as proposed, provided information relevant to treatment planning, course, and familial pattern. ',\n",
       "  'it should come as no surprise to the reader that even when data were available from relevant research studies, task force members often differed in their interpretations of the findings. ',\n",
       "  'advisory committees and other consultants. ',\n",
       "  'successive drafts of dsm-iii were prepared by fourteen advisory committees composed of individuals with special expertise in each substantive area. ',\n",

       "  'council on research and development. ',\n",
       "  'this component of the american psychiatric association appointed the task force and regularly reviewed progress being made in the development of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, in the fall of 1978 the council held an all-day meeting at which some apa members voiced concerns about certain aspects of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  \"after reviewing these concerns, the council approved the task force's approach to solutions of the problems that had been raised. \",\n",
       "  'assembly liaison committee. ',\n",
       "  \"in early 1976, the apa assembly, composed of representatives from all of the apa's district branches, appointed a liaison committee to review the development of dsm-iii and to report regularly to the assembly. \",\n",
       "  'this committee received correspondence on major issues, reviewed successive drafts of dsm-iii, and met a number of times with the chairperson of the task force. ',\n",
       "  'on several occasions the assembly liaison committee arranged for the chairperson of the task force to discuss a particular controversial issue with the entire assembly. ',\n",
       "  'the assembly liaison committee was invaluable in articulating the concerns of the membership of the apa, which is compose largely of clinicians whose primary professional activity is patient care. ',\n",
       "  'other components of the apa. ',\n",
       "  'the chairperson of the task force reported on several occasions to the reference committee and the board of trustees on specific issues of concern. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, in april 1979, a meeting was held with an 4  introduction ad hoc committee on dsm-iii of the board of trustees to review specific concerns about dsm-iii that had been expressed by members of the apa. ',\n",
       "  'other components of the apa, such as the committee on confidentiality and the committee on women, also reviewed dsm-iii from their own perspectives as it was being developed. ',\n",
       "  'liaison with other professional organizations. ',\n",
       "  'the following groups that were particularly interested in the development of dsm-iii established liaison committees with the task force: the academy of psychiatry and the law, the american academy of child psychiatry, the american academy of psychoanalysis, the american association of chairmen of departments of psychiatry, the american college health association, the american orthopsychiatric association, the american psychoanalytic association, and the american psychological association. ',\n",
       "  'these committees received drafts of dsm-iii and were invited to make comments and suggestions and to express their concerns. ',\n",
       "  'in most instances, differences in points of view between a liaison committee and the task force were resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned. ',\n",
       "  'when this was not possible and differences were left unresolved, the issues were at least clarified. ',\n",
       "  'the process of development of dsm-iii in may 1975, at a special session of the annual meeting of the apa, an initial draft of the dsm-iii classification was presented. ',\n",
       "  'at each subsequent annual meeting a special session was held on some aspect of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, a special conference was held in st. louis, missouri, in june 1976, to examine \"dsm-iii in midstream.\" this conference, co-sponsored by the missouri institute of psychiatry and the american psychiatric association, was attended by approximately 100 professionals with expertise or special interests in various aspects of dsm-iii, most of whom had previously had no direct involvement in the development of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'as a result of discussions at this conference, additional diagnostic categories were added, some were deleted, and a decision was made to proceed with the development of the multiaxial system. ',\n",
       "  'the dsm-iii classification and the rationale for the strategies used in its development have been presented throughout the past four years at local, national, and international professional meetings. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, the 4/15/77 draft and successive drafts of dsm-iii have been available to the profession for critical review. ',\n",
       "  'throughout this period there has been continual consideration of various solutions to difficult diagnostic problems, often based on summaries of actual cases submitted to the task force from all quarters. ',\n",
       "  'whenever possible, attempts have been made to seek the advice of experts in each specific area under consideration. ',\n",
       "  'field trials. ',\n",
       "  'in the past, new classifications of mental disorders have not been extensively subjected to clinical trials before official adoption. ',\n",
       "  'the task force believed that field trials using drafts of dsm-iii should be conducted during the development process to identify problem areas in the classification and to try out solutions to these problems. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, because of the many proposed changes in the classification, it was important to demonstrate its cliniintroduction  5 cal acceptability and usefulness in a variety of settings by clinicians of varying theoretical orientations. ',\n",
       "  'for these reasons, a series of field trials was conducted, beginning in 1977 and culminating in a two year nimh-sponsored field trial from september 1977 to september 1979. ',\n",
       "  'in all, 12,667 patients were evaluated by approximately 550 clinicians, 474 of whom were in 212 different facilities, using successive drafts of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'critiques of all portions of dsm-iii by the field trial participants resulted in numerous changes, as did reviews of case summaries submitted by those participants. ',\n",
       "  'frequently, participants completed questionnaires regarding specific diagnostic issues and their attitudes toward dsm-iii and its innovative features. ',\n",
       "  'the results indicated that the great majority of participants, regardless of theoretical orientations, had a favorable response to dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'perhaps the most important part of the study was the evaluation of diagnostic reliability by having pairs of clinicians make independent diagnostic judgments of several hundred patients. ',\n",
       "  'the results, which are presented in an appendix, generally indicate far greater reliability than had previously been obtained with dsm-ii. ',\n",
       "  'icd-9-cm. ',\n",
       "  'because of dissatisfaction with icd-9 expressed by organizations representing subspecialties of medicine (not including the american psychiatric association), a decision was made to modify the icd-9 for use in the united states by expanding the four-digit icd-9 codes to five-digit icd-9-cm (for clinical modification) codes whenever greater specificity was required. ',\n",
       "  'this modification was prepared for the united states national center for health statistics by the council on clinical classifications. ',\n",
       "  'the american psychiatric association, in december 1976, was invited to submit recommendations for alternate names and additional categories based on subdivisions of already existing icd-9 categories. ',\n",
       "  'this made it possible for the developing dsm-iii classification and its diagnostic terms to be included in the icd-9-cm classification, which in january 1979 became the official system in this country for recording all \"diseases, injuries, impairments, symptoms, and causes of death.\" the icd9-cm codes and diagnostic terms for mental disorders are included in appendix ',\n",

       "  'in may 1979, at the annual meeting of the apa in chicago, the assembly and the council on research and development formally approved the final draft of dsm-iii. ',\n",

       "  'basic concepts mental disorder. ',\n",
       "  'although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, there is no satisfactory definition that specifies precise boundaries for the concept \"mental disorder\" ',\n",
       "  '(also true for such concepts as physical disorder and 6  introduction mental and physical health). ',\n",
       "  'nevertheless, it is useful to present concepts that have influenced the decision to include certain conditions in dsm-iii as mental disorders and to exclude others. ',\n",
       "  'in dsm-iii each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is typically associated with either a painful symptom ',\n",
       "  '(distress) ',\n",
       "  'or impairment in one or more important areas of functioning ',\n",
       "  '(disability). ',\n",
       "  'in addition, there is an inference that there is a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction, and that the disturbance is not only in the relationship between the individual and society. ',\n",
       "  '(when the disturbance is limited to a conflict between an individual and society, this may represent social deviance, which may or may not be commendable, but is not by itself a mental disorder.) ',\n",
       "  'in dsm-iii there is no assumption that each mental disorder is a discrete entity with sharp boundaries ',\n",
       "  '(discontinuity) ',\n",
       "  'between it and other mental disorders, as well as between it and no mental disorder. ',\n",
       "  'for example, there has been a continuing controversy as to whether or not severe depressive disorder and mild depressive disorder differ from each other qualitatively ',\n",
       "  '(discontinuity between diagnostic entities) ',\n",
       "  'or quantitatively ',\n",
       "  '(a difference on a severity continuum). ',\n",
       "  'the inclusion of major depression with and without melancholia as separate categories in dsm-iii is justified by the clinical usefulness of the distinction. ',\n",
       "  'this does not imply a resolution of the controversy as to whether or not these conditions are in fact quantitatively or qualitatively different. ',\n",
       "  'a common misconception is that a classification of mental disorders classifies individuals, when actually what are being classified are disorders that individuals have. ',\n",
       "  'for this reason, the text of dsm-iii avoids the use of such phrases as \"a schizophrenic\" or \"an alcoholic,\" and instead uses the more accurate, but admittedly more wordy \"an individual with schizophrenia\" or \"an individual with alcohol dependence.\" another misconception is that all individuals described as having the same mental disorder are alike in all important ways. ',\n",
       "  'although all the individuals described as having the same mental disorder show at least the defining features of the disorder, they may well differ in other important ways that may affect clinical management and outcome. ',\n",
       "  'conditions not attributable to a mental disorder. ',\n",
       "  'in dsm-iii it is recognized that a behavioral or psychological problem may appropriately be a focus of professional attention or treatment even though it is not attributable to a mental disorder. ',\n",
       "  'a limited listing of codes, taken from the v codes section of icd-9-cm, is provided for noting such problems. ',\n",
       "  'descriptive approach. ',\n",
       "  'for some of the mental disorders, the etiology or pathophysiological processes are known. ',\n",
       "  'for example, in the organic mental disorders, organic factors necessary for the development of the disorders have been identified or are presumed. ',\n",
       "  'another example is adjustment disorder, in which the disturbance is a reaction to psychosocial stress. ',\n",
       "  'for most of the dsm-iii disorders, however, the etiology is unknown. ',\n",
       "  'a variety of theories have been advanced, buttressed by evidence—not always introduction  7 convincing—to explain how these disorders come about. ',\n",
       "  'the approach taken in dsm-iii is atheoretical with regard to etiology or pathophysiological process except for those disorders for which this is well established and therefore included in the definition of the disorder. ',\n",
       "  'undoubtedly, with time, some of the disorders of unknown etiology will be found to have specific biological etiologies, others to have specific psychological causes, and still others to result mainly from a particular interplay of psychological, social and biological factors. ',\n",
       "  'the major justification for the generally atheoretical approach taken in dsm-iii with regard to etiology is that the inclusion of etiological theories would be an obstacle to use of the manual by clinicians of varying theoretical orientations, since it would not be possible to present all reasonable etiological theories for each disorder. ',\n",
       "  'for example, phobic disorders are believed by many to represent a displacement of anxiety resulting from the breakdown of defensive operations for keeping internal conflict out of consciousness. ',\n",
       "  'other investigators explain phobias on the basis of learned avoidance responses to conditioned anxiety. ',\n",
       "  'still others believe that certain phobias result from a dysregulation of basic biological systems mediating separation anxiety. ',\n",
       "  'in any case, as the field trials have demonstrated, clinicians can agree on the identification of mental disorders on the basis of their clinical manifestations without agreeing on how the disturbances come about. ',\n",
       "  'because dsm-iii is generally atheoretical with regard to etiology, it attempts to describe comprehensively what the manifestations of the mental disorders are, and only rarely attempts to account for how the disturbances come about, unless the mechanism is included in the definition of the disorder. ',\n",
       "  'this approach can be said to be \"descriptive\" in that the definitions of the disorders generally consist of descriptions of the clinical features of the disorders. ',\n",
       "  'these features are described at the lowest order of inference necessary to describe the characteristic features of the disorder. ',\n",
       "  'frequently the order of inference is relatively low, and the characteristic features consist of easily identifiable behavioral signs or symptoms, such as disorientation, mood disturbance, or psychomotor agitation. ',\n",
       "  'for some disorders, however, particularly the personality disorders, a much higher order of inference is necessary. ',\n",
       "  'for example, one of the criteria for borderline personality disorder is \"identity disturbance manifested by uncertainty about several issues relating to identity, such as self-image, gender identity, long-term goals or career choice, friendship patterns, values and loyalties.\" this descriptive approach is also used in the division of the mental disorders into diagnostic classes. ',\n",
       "  'all of the disorders without known etiology or pathophysiological process are grouped together on the basis of shared clinical features. ',\n",
       "  'the subdivision of each diagnostic class into specific disorders, with even further subdivision in some cases, reflects the best judgment of the task force and its advisory committees that such subdivision will be useful. ',\n",
       "  'in this regard we have been guided by the judgments of those clinicians who will be making most use of each portion of the classification. ',\n",
       "  'for example, the subdivision of psychosexual dysfunctions into seven specific disorders is in response to the expressed needs of clinicians who specialize in the treatment of these conditions. ',\n",
       "  '(it soon became apparent that the criticism that a subdivision in a particular area of the classification was useless always came from clinicians who specialized 8  introduction in other areas.) ',\n",
       "  'it should be noted, however, that the judgments of clinicians concerning the necessity for including new categories were not accepted uncritically. ',\n",
       "  'although initially many new categories were added in an effort to be inclusive, experience in the field trials and lack of validity evidence from the literature resulted in the elimination of several proposed categories. ',\n",
       "  'diagnostic criteria. ',\n",
       "  'since in dsm-i, dsm-ii, and icd-9 explicit criteria are not provided, the clinician is largely on his or her own in defining the content and boundaries of the diagnostic categories. ',\n",
       "  'in contrast, dsm-iii provides specific diagnostic criteria as guides for making each diagnosis since such criteria enhance interjudge diagnostic reliability. ',\n",
       "  'it should be understood, however, that for most of the categories the diagnostic criteria are based on clinical judgment, and have not yet been fully validated by data about such important correlates as clinical course, outcome, family history, and treatment response. ',\n",

       "  'neurotic disorders throughout the development of dsm-iii the omission of the dsm-ii diagnostic class of neuroses has been a matter of great concern to many clinicians, and requires an explanation. ',\n",
       "  'when freud first used the term \"psychoneurosis,\" he was referring to only four subtypes: anxiety neurosis, anxiety hysteria ',\n",
       "  '(phobia), obsessive compulsive neurosis, and hysteria. ',\n",
       "  'freud used the term both descriptively ',\n",
       "  '(to indicate a painful symptom in an individual with intact reality testing) ',\n",
       "  'and to indicate the etiological process ',\n",
       "  '(unconscious conflict arousing anxiety and leading to the maladaptive use of defensive mechanisms that result in symptom formation). ',\n",
       "  'at the present time, however, there is no consensus in our field as to how to define \"neurosis.\" some clinicians limit the term to its descriptive meaning whereas others also include the concept of a specific etiological process. ',\n",
       "  'to avoid ambiguity, the term neurotic disorder should be used only descriptively. ',\n",
       "  'this is consistent with the use of this term in icd-9. ',\n",
       "  'the term neurotic process, on the other hand, should be used when the clinician wishes to indicate the concept of a specific etiological process involving the following sequence: unconscious conflicts between opposing wishes or between wishes and prohibitions, which causes unconscious perception of anticipated danger or dysphoria, which leads to use of defense mechanisms that result in either symptoms, personality disturbance, or both. ',\n",
       "  'the term neurotic disorder thus refers to a mental disorder in which the predominant disturbance is a symptom or group of symptoms that is distressing 10  introduction to the individual and is recognized by him or her as unacceptable and alien ',\n",
       "  '(ego-dystonic); reality testing is grossly intact; behavior does not actively violate gross social norms ',\n",
       "  '(although functioning may be markedly impaired); the disturbance is relatively enduring or recurrent without treatment and is not limited to a transitory reaction to stressors; and there is no demonstrable organic etiology or factor. ',\n",
       "  'although many psychodynamically-oriented clinicians believe that the neurotic process always plays a central role in the development of neurotic disorders, there are other theories about how these disorders develop. ',\n",
       "  'for example, there are social learning, cognitive, behavioral, and biological models that attempt to explain the development of various neurotic disorders. ',\n",
       "  'thus, the term neurotic disorder is used in dsm-iii without any implication of a special etiological process. ',\n",
       "  'neurotic disorder, defined descriptively, is roughly equivalent to the psychoanalytic concept of \"symptom neurosis.\" ',\n",
       "  '(this is distinguished from \"character neurosis\" which is roughly equivalent to the dsm-iii concept of personality disorder. according to modern psychoanalytic theory, the neurotic process is involved in the development of both symptom neuroses and character neuroses.) ',\n",
       "  'in dsm-iii the neurotic disorders are included in affective, anxiety, somatoform, dissociative, and psychosexual disorders. ',\n",
       "  'these diagnostic classes are listed together in the dsm-iii classification to facilitate the location of neurotic disorders. ',\n",
       "  'preceding the listing of the class of affective disorders is a statement indicating that neurotic disorders are included in these five dsmiii classes. ',\n",
       "  'it should be noted that the icd-9 category neurotic disorders, also defined descriptively, includes only those categories that historically have been included as \"neuroses\" in previous standard classifications. ',\n",
       "  'these previous classifications did not contain some of the dsm-iii categories, such as psychosexual disorders, that unquestionably include some disorders falling within the concept of neurotic disorders. ',\n",
       "  'alternative approaches to the issue of the relationship of neurotic disorders to the dsm-iii classification were considered. ',\n",
       "  'if the dsm-iii classification had included a category of neurotic disorders that was limited to those disorders included in the icd-9 category, the potential value of the term neurotic disorder would have been limited by a lack of adherence to its descriptive meaning. ',\n",
       "  'on the other hand, to have grouped together all of the specific dsmiii categories that are usually considered to be neurotic disorders would have required separating some affective disorders from the other affective disorders, some psychosexual disorders from the other psychosexual disorders, and some dissociative disorders from other members of that class. ',\n",
       "  'the possible advantages of this approach seemed to be far outweighed by the disadvantage of fragmenting several diagnostic classes. ',\n",
       "  'similarly, it was judged unwise to group all psychotic disorders together, as is done in icd-9. ',\n",

',\n",
       "  '•\\t given that most psychiatric symptoms can occur in  normal people, and given our lack of knowledge of  psychological and biological mechanisms underlying  symptoms, various strategies must be used to ensure  that symptom-based criteria are pathosuggestive and  imply the presence of dysfunction, such as requiring  an extended symptom duration that is greater than  expected in a normal person or excluding diagnosis  when the context is one in which symptoms are more  likely to represent normal-range responses. ',\n",
       "  '•\\t such strategies should be systematically elaborated  and applied to current and future dsm criteria sets  with the goal of reducing the risk of false positives and  responding to public concerns about the pathologization  of problems of living. ',\n",
       "  'i n the context of making a psychiatric diagnosis, the  diagnostic criteria for a disorder have 2 functions: to help  the clinician differentiate the disorder from other disorders  that share clinical features (for example, distinguishing  mdd from dysthymia or bipolar disorder) and to  help differentiate disorder from nondisordered normal  presentations (for example, distinguishing mdd from  normal sadness or normal grief). ',\n",
       "  'it is the second of these 2  functions that has been the focus of most of the criticism of  the latest edition of the manual, dsm-5.1 the claim has been  that the dsm-5 definitions for numerous disorders fail to  validly differentiate disordered symptomatic presentations  from nondisordered symptomatic presentations, thus  creating a risk of wholesale false-positive diagnoses.2 the dsm’s definition of mental disorder and how it  is applied to the various specific disorders is key to  approaching the false-positives problem systematically.  ',\n",
       "  'discrepancies between the definition’s requirements and  the diagnostic criteria for a specific category are often at the  root of problems of false-positive diagnosies.3 the dsm-5  definition of mental disorder, which is a minor modification  of the definition that has appeared in all dsms since dsmiii, states that  a mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by  clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s  cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that  reflects a dysfunction in the psychological,  biological, or developmental processes underlying  mental functioning.1, p 20 moreover, the definition specifies that even such potentially  problematic conditions as socially deviant behaviour and  conflicts between the individual and society “are not mental  disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a  dysfunction in the individual, as described above.”1, p 20 according to dsm-5’s definition, there are 2 requirements  for a syndrome to be considered indicative of a mental  disorder. ',\n",
       "  'first, there must be sufficient evidence to infer  that the syndromal symptoms represent a dysfunction in  the processes underlying mental functioning. ',\n",
       "  'second, this  dysfunction must cause harm to the person in the form of a  disturbance in psychological functioning that is “clinically  significant,”1, p 20 which, as the definition further specifies,  generally translates into distress or social role impairment  that is sufficiently serious to warrant clinical attention.  ',\n",
       "  'the argument for accepting these central aspects of the  dsm’s approach to the concept of mental disorder, and  for understanding the definition’s reference to dysfunction  as meaning failure of biologically designed functioning  of psychological mechanisms or processes, has been  persuasively elaborated in wakefield’s harmful dysfunction  analysis of the concept of mental disorder (see wakefield4–9  and wakefield and first10), and will not be reiterated here. ',\n",
       "  'logically, each diagnostic category in the dsm that is  claimed to be a mental disorder must satisfy the conditions  set forth in the definition of mental disorder. ',\n",
       "  'the dsm-5 is  the first edition of the manual to make this principle fully  explicit when introducing the definition: “each disorder  la fréquence ou l’intensité d’un symptôme excèdent celles observées chez une personne  normale; exigence de la disproportion des symptômes, dans un contexte donné; exigence  de l’omniprésence de l’expression des symptômes dans tout  contexte; ajout d’exclusions  spécifiques pour des scénarios contextuels dans lesquels les symptômes doivent être compris  comme des réactions normales; combinaison des symptômes pour accroître la pathosuggestivité  cumulative; et exigence d’un nombre suffisant de symptômes pour atteindre un seuil minimum  de pathosuggestivité. nous proposons que les futures révisions du dsm envisagent la mise  en œuvre systématique de ces stratégies dans la construction et la révision des ensembles de  critères, dans le but de maximiser la pathosuggestivité des critères diagnostiques et de réduire le  potentiel de diagnostics faux positifs. www.thecjp.ca the canadian journal of psychiatry, vol 58, no 12, december 2013   w   665 diagnostic criteria as dysfunction indicators:  bridging the chasm between the definition of mental disorder and diagnostic criteria for specific disorders identified in section ii of the manual . . . must meet the  definition of a mental disorder. . . . [t]he following elements  are required . . .”1, p 20 to ensure that each dsm disorder meets the requirements  for being a mental disorder, diagnostic criteria must include  elements indicative of both harm and dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'in  general, operationalizing the harm requirement is much  more straightforward than establishing the presence of  dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'the harm requirement can be explicitly  stated as a criterion. ',\n",
       "  'for example, the clinical significance  criterion (that is, “the disturbance causes clinically  significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,  or other important areas of functioning”1, p 21) is included  in most diagnostic criteria sets specifically to establish that  the harm threshold for diagnosis of a disorder has been met.  ',\n",
       "  'often the symptoms listed in the diagnostic criteria and the  features of the symptoms used to support the inference to  dysfunction (for example, long duration and association  with other symptoms) are manifestly harmful and any  further specification of the harm requirement is redundant.  ',\n",
       "  'for example, the mdd clinical significance criterion has  been shown to be redundant and unnecessary in this way; if  you have sufficient symptoms to qualify for mdd, you will  almost certainly report significant distress or impairment in  your role functioning.11–13 however, rarely a dsm-5 category’s symptoms are mild  enough that the harm requirement is not clearly satisfied.  ',\n",
       "  'for example, diagnosis of the new dsm-5 category of mild  neurocognitive disorder requires only modest decline from  previous performance in any cognitive domain, and limits  their impact on the individual by also requiring that the  declines “do not interfere with capacity for independence  in everyday activities.”1, p 605 clinical significance is not  required. ',\n",
       "  'such nonimpairing decline, either ignored or  easily addressed by modest compensatory strategies, is  common in normal aging and does not seem to rise to harm  levels warranting disorder diagnosis. ',\n",
       "  'in contrast, formulating criteria that establish the presence  of an internal dysfunction is much more challenging. ',\n",
       "  'this  is primarily because of the necessarily inferential nature of  identifying dysfunction, given our current lack of knowledge  of internal psychological and biological processes and their  functions and dysfunctions. ',\n",
       "  'objective laboratory evidence  that a brain dysfunction exists and underlies a psychological  disturbance, such as diagnostically specific abnormal brain  imaging findings known to be the result of brain pathology,  would obviate the need for inference, but such tests are  unavailable at this time. ',\n",
       "  'because of the absence of such explicit biomarkers,  dysfunction must instead be inferred from the symptomatic  presentation together with the contextual circumstances  plausibly implying the breakdown of a normally operating  psychological or biological function. ',\n",
       "  'this was the same  situation that existed in physical medicine before knowledge  of etiology, when the presence of disorder was inferred  from symptomatic presentations that were concluded to  be inconsistent with normal functioning. ',\n",
       "  'the challenge is  greater with mental disorders because of the greater overlap  of psychological symptoms indicative of disorder with  normal reactions. ',\n",
       "  'in practical terms, given that virtually every psychiatric  symptom characteristic of a dsm disorder can occur in  some form or in some context in a normally functioning  person, criteria based on symptoms must be constructed  in such a way as to indicate that the symptom cannot  reasonably be considered normal (that is, within the range  of normal functioning). ',\n",
       "  'for example, even though it is  normal for a person to experience transient periods of  depressed mood from time to time, when that depressed  mood is persistent and part of a syndrome of co-occurring  symptoms, such as sleep and appetite disturbance, fatigue,  suicidality, and cognitive distortions regarding self-worth,  one can plausibly infer an underlying dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'consequently, the main challenge in creating valid  diagnostic criteria for a dsm category is to show that  dysfunction can be inferred from the symptom criteria,  possibly taking into account the context in which the  symptoms occur.3,14 to our knowledge, there has been no  systematic exploration of how this is accomplished. ',\n",
       "  'in this  paper, we perform an initial reconnaissance of the various  strategies that are used in formulating dsm diagnostic  criteria to indicate that a symptomatic presentation meets the  dysfunction requirement, and the challenges each strategy  faces. ',\n",
       "  'it should be noted that by validity of diagnostic  criteria we refer here to conceptual validity,4,15 the degree to  which criteria identify disorders and not nondisorders, thus  avoiding false-positive diagnoses. ',\n",
       "  'varying pathosuggestiveness   of individual symptoms symptoms differ in the degree to which they lend  support to an inference to underlying dysfunction and  thus suggest disorder (that is, are pathosuggestive). ',\n",
       "  'a  few psychiatric symptoms, typically those that indicate a  major deficit in functioning, are highly pathosuggestive  and almost invariably indicate a dysfunction (for example,  severe intellectual disability with an iq of less than 50).  ',\n",
       "  'however, most psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, fear,  depression, and irritability, are ubiquitous in normal people  and occur under some circumstances as part of the normal  range of emotional expression, thus are not particularly  pathosuggestive in themselves. ',\n",
       "  'when symptoms with low  inherent pathosuggestiveness—for example, sadness or  insomnia—appear in diagnostic criteria, their usefulness  in adding to the support for the dysfunction hypothesis  will depend on their interaction with a wide range of  modifiers and other criteria, such as those requiring  persistence, chronicity, being part of a syndrome, and being  disproportionate to the environmental context. ',\n",
       "  'conversely, symptoms that are more highly pathosuggestive  in themselves tend to require fewer accompanying  indicators of dysfunction and contextual qualifiers. ',\n",
       "  'some  symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, have a  high level of pathosuggestiveness because, in their severe,  www.larcp.ca 666   w   la revue canadienne de psychiatrie, vol 58, no 12, décembre 2013 in review impairing form, they most commonly occur in people  suffering from a mental illness. ',\n",
       "  'however, studies reveal  that substantial percentages of people in the community  report occasionally experiencing such symptoms in milder  or transient form,16–21 even apart from specific contexts in  which such symptoms are known to become more frequent  among people who are nondisordered, such as during  substance intoxication or withdrawal, in the context of  bereavement, in people under extreme stress, or as part of  some culturally sanctioned practices.22–26 consequently,  even delusions and hallucinations are not completely  pathosuggestive, and some additional diagnostic criteria  or contextual considerations are almost always needed to  secure the inference to dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'in general, the lower  the pathosuggestiveness of a symptom, the greater the need  to use one or more of the strategies we enumerate below  for distinguishing symptoms indicative of dysfunction from  normally generated symptoms. ',\n",
       "  'duration and persistence as   indicators of dysfunction perhaps the most common technique used to indicate that a  symptom is indicative of a dysfunction is to add modifiers  requiring a minimum duration. ',\n",
       "  'many symptoms, such as  transient fears and sadness, can look the same as symptoms  of disorder. ',\n",
       "  'however, their brief occurrence generally  indicates normal affective variation, so requiring lengthy  duration tends to support the inference to dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'for  example, in dsm-5, most of the anxiety disorders (for  example, separation anxiety disorder in adults, specific  phobia, social anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia) now  require that symptoms must be “persistent, typically lasting  for 6 months or more.”1, p 203 similarly, the persistence  requirement for mde that the symptoms be present for  most of the day, nearly every day is also an attempt to  distinguish mde from normal everyday sadness, which  is more likely to come and go throughout the day. ',\n",
       "  'the  appropriate duration requirement for a given disorder will  depend on background assumptions about which durations  are long enough to substantially reduce the likelihood that  the symptoms are not indicative of dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'however, in the case of affects such as sadness or anxiety, it  is obvious that a duration or persistence requirement alone  does not ensure that the symptom represents dysfunction  because emotions triggered by contextual circumstances  can sometimes last for similar durations, especially if  the triggering circumstances themselves persist. ',\n",
       "  'for  example, fear of going outside for 6 months or more may  be reasonable and within normal range for an individual  living in a city under siege during wartime where there are  real dangers involved in leaving one’s home, and sadness  due to a sequence of ongoing serious losses may also be  lengthy but normal. ',\n",
       "  'consequently, other techniques, such  as requiring the sadness to be part of a larger syndrome  with other more pathosuggestive symptoms (see below), or  requiring, as in the diagnostic criteria for specific phobia,  that “the fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual  danger . . . and to the sociocultural context,”1, p 197 must also  be employed to support the inference to dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'frequency–intensity modifiers   as an indicator of dysfunction another common technique is to append a modifier requiring  that either the frequency or intensity of a symptom be at a  level beyond what would be considered the typical frequency  or intensity for such a symptom in a normal person. ',\n",
       "  'for  example, in recognition that some symptoms of inattention,  hyperactivity, and impulsivity commonly occur in normal  people, each criterion for adhd requires that the symptom  occur often (for example, “often fails to give close attention  to details or makes careless mistakes”1, p 59). ',\n",
       "  'similarly, the  criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, in recognition  that the symptoms commonly occur in normal premenstrual  women and thus do not necessarily indicate dysfunction,  generally preface each symptom with the modifier marked  (for example, “marked affective lability”1, p 171) to increase  the likelihood that the symptoms represent an underlying  dysfunction rather than normal perimenstrual symptoms. ',\n",
       "  'in  both of these cases, it is implied that the requirement for  increased frequency and intensity is to be judged relative  to the baseline of what is typically seen in normal people. ',\n",
       "  'however, symptoms normally vary in intensity owing to  individual temperament and context. ',\n",
       "  'for example, a person  satisfying adhd criterion a.1.d, “often does not follow  through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork,  chores, or duties in the workplace,”1 p 59 rather than having  a dysfunction, may simply not understand the instructions  owing to placement in a class that is too academically  challenging,  a  contextual  factor  acknowledged  in  dsm-5’s instruction not to count the symptom if it is  “solely a manifestation of . . . failure to understand tasks  or instructions.”1 p 59 such contextual factors must be  considered when determining the significance of the  frequency or intensity of the symptom (see below). ',\n",
       "  'to contribute to validity, the frequency and duration  requirements must be sufficient to indicate not merely  that a symptom occurs regularly or is problematic but that    it occurs often enough to suggest that it is due to dysfunction  rather than being explainable in terms of normal  causes. ',\n",
       "  'this has led to concern, for example, about the    dsm-5 binge eating disorder requirement that “the    binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3  months,”1, p 350 which seems consistent with normal-range  excessive eating at social events, and the dsm-5 oppositional  defiant disorder requirement that in children “5 years or older,  the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least  6 months,”1, p 462 which seems consistent with normal-range  behaviour at that age. ',\n",
       "  'disproportionality in determining whether a symptom is evidence of  dysfunction, the most direct way of taking context into  account is to require that the intensity of the symptom be  out of proportion to any environmental triggers, when the  www.thecjp.ca the canadian journal of psychiatry, vol 58, no 12, december 2013   w   667 diagnostic criteria as dysfunction indicators:  bridging the chasm between the definition of mental disorder and diagnostic criteria for specific disorders symptom is normally a proportional response. ',\n",
       "  'for example,  the criteria for the phobic anxiety disorders require that  the anxiety symptoms be out of proportion to the actual  danger posed by the situation (for example, social situations  in social anxiety disorder, and the phobic stimulus in  specific phobia). ',\n",
       "  'similarly, the criteria for intermittent  explosive disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation  disorder require that aggressive outbursts be grossly out of  proportion to the provoking circumstances. ',\n",
       "  'in other cases,  the disproportionality requirement is implied by use of  modifiers such as excessive, as in the generalized anxiety  disorder requirement of excessive anxiety and worry about  numerous events or activities. ',\n",
       "  'the rationale for such criteria is that most human  psychological reactions are biologically designed to  vary in intensity in accordance with some features of the  perceived context. ',\n",
       "  'for example, fear can range from mild  apprehension to outright terror, depending on the degree  of danger or imminence of harm. ',\n",
       "  'similarly, anger can go  from mild indignation to uncontrollable rage depending  on the degree of perceived threat or violation. ',\n",
       "  'substantial  and chronic disproportionality between the nature of  the environmental stimulus and the reaction suggests  an underlying dysfunction in calibration of response.  ',\n",
       "  'however, the inference to dysfunction can be influenced by  further factors that influence intensity of response, such as  individual temperamental variation and cultural shaping of  appropriate levels of response. ',\n",
       "  'pervasiveness as an indicator of dysfunction another  indicator  of  pathosuggestiveness  is  the  pervasiveness of the expression of a symptom. ',\n",
       "  'given that  most false positives in terms of dysfunction reflect that  the symptom is better understood as a normal response  to an environmentally determined contextual factor, if the  symptom is present across a wide variety of contextual  factors, it suggests that the symptom is most likely due to  an internal dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'for example, adhd diagnosis  requires that  several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms are present in two or more settings   (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or  relatives; in other activities).1, p 60  the same strategy is used in the criteria for the new dsm-5  disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, which requires that  temper outbursts and irritable mood “are present in at least two  of three settings (i.e., at home, at school, with peers).”1, p 156 pervasiveness is also sometimes indicated by polythetic  criteria sets that require a subset of multiple different  specified situations in which a dysfunction may express  itself. ',\n",
       "  'for example, the criteria set for paranoid personality  disorder lists various situations—unjustified doubts about  the loyalties of friends and associates, being reluctant to  confide in others, reading hidden meanings into benign  remarks, perceiving unjustified attacks on one’s character,  and unjustified suspicions regarding the fidelity of a spouse  or sexual partner—in which the same dysfunction of  inability to trust other people may be manifested. ',\n",
       "  'requiring  at least 4 of these items implies pervasiveness of mistrust  across situations, supporting the hypothesis that it represents  an internal dysfunction in an ability to trust rather than a  normal reaction to threatening situations. ',\n",
       "  'contextual exclusions of false-positive  scenarios indicative of nondysfunction an alternative strategy involves adding specific exclusions  for contextual scenarios in which the symptoms are best  understood as normal reactions.14 for example, as in  dsm-iv, in dsm-5, selective mutism is diagnosable  only if “the failure to speak is not attributable to a lack  of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language  required in the social situation.”1, p 195 in such cases, the  failure to speak, rather than representing an internal  dysfunction, is understandable as a normal response to  lack of familiarity with the required spoken language.  ',\n",
       "  'analogously, dsm-5 oppositional defiant disorder newly  excludes diagnosis if the defiant behaviour is directed only  toward a sibling, because sibling relations can normally  include such behaviour. ',\n",
       "  'likewise, dsm-5 introduces the  requirement that a sexual dysfunction can be diagnosed  only if the lack of sexual response in a relationship is not  better explained as a consequence of severe relationship  distress (for example, partner violence). ',\n",
       "  'requiring additional pathosuggestive  symptoms as an indicator of dysfunction a standard strategy for increasing the pathosuggestiveness  of a disorder definition is to require multiple features to  be present so that the overall pathosuggestiveness of the  criteria set reflects the cumulative pathosuggestiveness of  the various required symptoms. ',\n",
       "  'monothetic criteria sets, in  which each individual criterion must be met to make the  diagnosis, use this approach, with each successive required  criterion increasing the cumulative pathosuggestiveness  of the whole. ',\n",
       "  'for example, the social anxiety disorder  definition requires that all of criteria a through j be met  for the diagnosis to be made, with each criterion serving to  increase the likelihood that the social anxiety and avoidance  represents an internal dysfunction rather than normal  variation in the trait of shyness. ',\n",
       "  'such a strategy can also be used in improving the  pathosuggestiveness of individual criterion items. ',\n",
       "  'for  example, manic episode’s criterion a requires elevated,  expansive, or irritable mood, but this was found to be subject  to false positives owing to circumstantial reasons for, say,  irritability.27 thus dsm-5 improved the pathosuggestiveness  of this criterion by adding a requirement of increased activity  or energy as well, in addition to the elevated, expansive, or  irritable mood. ',\n",
       "  'the combined pathosuggestiveness is likely  to be more than simply additive. ',\n",
       "  'www.larcp.ca 668   w   la revue canadienne de psychiatrie, vol 58, no 12, décembre 2013 in review using symptom thresholds in a syndrome   as an indicator of dysfunction the dsm-5 definition of mental disorder specifies that  each mental disorder is a syndrome. ',\n",
       "  'the identification  of syndromes was a cornerstone of diagnosis in the early  days of medicine and remains so for fields of medicine  for which the underlying pathophysiology is largely  unknown, such as headaches, rheumatological diseases,  and psychiatric conditions. ',\n",
       "  'a syndrome may be defined as  a group of symptoms that tend to occur together and tend  to have an identifiable course. ',\n",
       "  'although in some cases a  particular symptom is defined to be a required component  of the syndrome, in many cases no specific symptom is  essential, reflecting the heterogeneity of the symptomatic  presentations of the syndrome. ',\n",
       "  'in dsm, such heterogeneity  is reflected in the use of polythetic criteria sets, in which a  minimum number of items from a longer list are required  (for example, the 3 out of 7 items required in the b criterion  for a manic episode). ',\n",
       "  'however, identification of syndromal, co-occurring  symptoms does not necessarily imply that the underlying  etiological process is a dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'for example, normal  grief involves a cluster of symptoms that tend to co-occur,  including yearning for the deceased, intense sorrow,  disbelief, emotional numbness, bitterness or anger about  the loss, avoidance of reminders of the loss, feeling alone or  detached from others, desire to die to be with the deceased,  feeling that life is empty without the deceased, and others.  ',\n",
       "  'these symptoms co-occur (that is, comprise a syndrome)  because they are all responses to the same causative factor,  that is, the death of a loved one. ',\n",
       "  'however, the presence of  this syndrome does not imply the presence of dysfunction,  because each of these symptoms, as well as any subset, can  be a manifestation of a normal and expected reaction to loss. ',\n",
       "  'the need for diagnostic thresholds that require a minimum  number of symptoms when setting the boundary with  normality (for example, the requirement for 5 out of 9  symptoms in mdd) reflects that the pathosuggestiveness  of each symptom, taken on its own, is insufficient to allow  inference to dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'however, as more symptoms are  determined to be present, the aggregate pathosuggestiveness  can become sufficient for a confident inference to  underlying dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'for example, depressed mood  and difficulty sleeping, by themselves, have relatively  low pathosuggestiveness, but the presence of additional  depressive symptoms, such as decreased appetite, fatigue,  and feelings of worthlessness, increase the likelihood of  underlying dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'viewed in this light, rather than representing zones of  rarity in a symptom-severity continuum or cut-points that  are associated with a risk for a negative outcome (as is the  case with blood pressure thresholds), the dsm symptom  thresholds instead represent thresholds of minimum clinical  confidence that a dysfunction is present. ',\n",
       "  'this is in accord  with the expert consensus method by which most of the  symptom thresholds in the dsm were established; that is, a  group of experts set thresholds based on their intuitive sense  regarding the minimum number of symptoms required for  the diagnosis. ',\n",
       "  'for example, when the developer of the  original mde criteria was asked about the basis for the  particular chosen threshold of 6 out of 10 symptoms, he  replied “it sounded about right.”28, p 136 one serious problem with trying to establish a threshold  for the minimum number of symptoms based on an  intuitive sense of cumulative pathosuggestiveness is that  the pathosuggestiveness associated with each particular  symptom in the syndrome is not equivalent. ',\n",
       "  'some  symptoms of depression (for example, psychomotor  retardation) are much more pathosuggestive than others (for  example, insomnia). ',\n",
       "  'nevertheless, all are generally given  equal weight regarding symptom count. ',\n",
       "  'unfortunately,  establishing appropriate differential weights to the  individual symptoms comprising a syndrome would be  difficult to accomplish empirically and may add a level of  unwieldy complexity to the diagnostic definitions. ',\n",
       "  'the differential evidential weight possessed by symptoms,  combined with the fact that they are given equal weight  in dsm diagnostic algorithms, leads to the potential for  substantial false-positive diagnoses among conditions  in which the diagnostic threshold can be reached using  a subset of symptoms with relatively low cumulative  pathosuggestiveness. ',\n",
       "  'this problem is especially likely to  occur when relatively few symptoms are required to reach  threshold. ',\n",

       "  'the substantial need for nos criteria, excessive comorbidity, the mismatch between real-world populations and “pure” clinical trials samples, arbitrary and rigid diagnostic thresholds, and the gulf between dsm-iv disorders and emerging results of genetic studies all point to signiﬁcant failures inherent in the current dsm-iv classiﬁcation. ',\n",
       "  'the problems that have emerged within the dsm “paradigm” (based on operationalized criteria that deﬁne a large number of categorical disorders) cannot be ﬁxed by tinkering with existing criteria sets or by adding or subtracting diagnoses at the margins. ',\n",

       "  'it is a good sign that the nimh has begun a program to develop new ways of classifying mental disorders for research purposes, called the research domain criteria (rdoc) initiative, meant to incorporate data from genetics, psychology, human and animal neurobiology, and clinical trials.
