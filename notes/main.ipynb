',\n",
       "  'the latter group of disorders has less secure footing in this block than the former because it contains many disorders that are symptomatically similar to conditions classified in other blocks (f20 f29, f30 f39, f40 f49, f60 f69) and are known to occur without gross cerebral pathological change or dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'however, the growing evidence that a variety of cerebral and systemic diseases are causally related to the occurrence of such syndromes provides sufficient justification for their inclusion here in a clinically oriented classification. ',\n",

       "  'in assessing the presence or absence of a dementia, special care should be taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional factors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and general physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may account for failure to perform. ',\n",
       "  'dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning, and usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, such as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and toilet activities. ',\n",

',\n",
       "  'the dysfunction may be primary, as in diseases, injuries, and insults that affect the brain directly or with predilection; or secondary, as in systemic diseases and disorders that attack the brain only as one of the multiple organs or systems of the body involved. ',\n",
       "  'alcoholand drug-caused brain disorders, though logically belonging to this group, are classified under f10-f19 because of practical advantages in keeping all disorders due to psychoactive substance use in a single block.  ',\n",
       "  'although the spectrum of psychopathological manifestations of the conditions included here is broad, the essential features of the disorders form two main clusters. ',\n",
       "  'on the one hand, there are syndromes in which the invariable and most prominent features are either disturbances of cognitive functions, such as memory, intellect, and learning, or disturbances of the sensorium, such as disorders of consciousness and attention. ',\n",
       "  'on the other hand, there are syndromes of which the most conspicuous manifestations are in the areas of perception (hallucinations), thought contents (delusions), or mood and emotion (depression, elation, anxiety), or in the overall pattern of personality and behaviour, while cognitive or sensory dysfunction is minimal or difficult to ascerta in. ',\n",
       "  'the latter group of disorders has less secure footing in this block than the former because it contains many disorders that are symptomatically similar to conditions classified in other blocks (f20 f29, f30 f39, f40 f49, f60 f69) and are known to occur without gross cerebral pathological change or dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'however, the growing evidence that a variety of cerebral and systemic diseases are causally related to the occurrence of such syndromes provides sufficient justification for their inclusion here in a clinically oriented classification.  ',\n",
       "  'the majority of the disorders in this block can, at least theoretically, have their onset at any age, except perhaps early childhood. ',\n",
       "  'in practice, most tend to start in adult life or old age. ',\n",
       "  'while some of these disorders are seemingly irreversible and progressive, others are transient or respond to currently available treatments.  ',\n",
       "  'use of the term \"organic\" does not imply that conditions elsewhere in this classification are \"nonorganic\" in the sense of having no cerebral substrate. ',\n",
       "  'in the present context, the term \"organic\" means simply that the syndrome so classified can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or  44                                   f00-f09 organic mental disorders  systemic disease or disorder. ',\n",
       "  'the term \"symptomatic\" is used for those organic mental disorders in which cerebral involvement is secondary to a systemic extracerebral disease or disorder.  ',\n",
       "  'it follows from the foregoing that, in the majority of cases, the recording of a diagnosis of any one of the disorders in this block will require the use of two codes: one for the psychopathological syndrome and another for the underlying disorder. ',\n",
       "  'the etiological code should be selected from the relevant chapter of the overall icd-10 classification.  ',\n",
       "  'dementia  a general description of dementia is given here, to indicate the minimum requirement for the diagnosis of dementia of any type, and is followed by the criteria that govern the diagnosis of more specific types.  ',\n",
       "  'dementia is a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, in which there is disturbance of multiple higher cortical functions, including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgement. ',\n",

       "  'in assessing the presence or absence of a dementia, special care should be taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional factors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and general physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may account for failure to perform.  ',\n",
       "  'dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning, and usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, such as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and toilet activities. ',\n",

       "  'changes in role performance, such as lowered ability to keep or find a job, should not be used as criteria of dementia because of the large cross-cultural differences that exist in what is appropriate, and because there may be frequent, externally imposed changes in the availability of work within a particular culture.

(note: the catatonic symptoms of stupor, mutism, negativism, and posturing in manic episodes are also considered mood-incongruent psychotic features.)  neologisms. new words invented by the subject, distortions of words, or standard words to which the subject has given new, highly idiosyncratic meaning. the judgment that neologisms are present should be made cautiously, taking into account the subject\\'s educational and cultural background. examples: \"i was accused of midigation\" (meaning the subject was accused of breaking the law). \"they had an insinuating machine next door\" (person explaining how her neighbors were bothering her).     neologisms may be observed in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  neurotic disorder. a mental disorder in which the predominant disturbance is a symptom or group of symptoms that is distressing to the individual and is recognized by him or her as unacceptable and alien (ego-dystonic); reality testing is grossly intact. behavior does not actively violate gross social norms (though it may be quite disabling). the disturbance is relatively enduring or recurrent without treatment, and is not limited to a transitory reaction to stressors. there is no demonstrable organic etiology or factor.  neurotic process. a specific etiological process involving the following                                         glossary of technical terms 365  sequence: (1) unconscious conflicts between opposing desires or between desires and prohibitions, which cause (2) unconscious perception of anticipated danger or dysphoria, which leads to (3) use of defense mechanisms that result in (4) either symptoms, personality disturbance, or both.  obsessions. recurrent, persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses that are ego-dystonic, that is, they are not experienced as voluntarily produced, but rather as ideas that invade consciousness.     obsessions are characteristic of obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be seen in schizophrenia.  orientation. awareness of where one is in relation to time, place, and person.  overvalued idea. an unreasonable and sustained belief or idea that is maintained with less than delusional intensity. it differs from an obsessional thought in that the person holding the overvalued idea does not recognize its absurdity and thus does not struggle against it. as with a delusion, the idea or belief is not one that is ordinarily accepted by other members of the person\\'s culture or subculture.     example: a patient with a long-standing hand-washing compulsion thought there might be danger in shaking hands with people, because they might have recently been inoculated against smallpox and be infectious. although she acknowledged that the danger might not be real, she could not accept reassurances that there was medically no danger.  panic attacks. discrete periods of sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness, or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. during the attacks there are such symptoms as dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain or discomfort, choking or smothering sensations, and fear of going crazy or losing control.     panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder, but may also occur in somatization disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.  paranoid ideation. ideation, of less than delusional proportions, involving suspiciousness or the belief that one is being harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated. in some instances the term is used when the clinician is unsure of whether the disturbances are actually delusional. ideas of reference often involve paranoid ideation.  perseveration. persistent repetition of words, ideas, or subjects so that, once an individual begins speaking about a particular subject or uses a particular word, it continually recurs. perseveration differs from the repetitive use of \"stock words\" or interjections such as \"you know\" or \"like.\"     examples: \"i think i\\'ll put on my hat, my hat, my hat, my hat.\" interviewer: \"tell me what you are like, what kind of person you are.\" subject:   366 appendix b  \"i\\'m from marshalltown, iowa. that\\'s 60 miles northwest, northeast of des moines, iowa. and i\\'m married at the present time. i\\'m 36 years old. my wife is 35. she lives in garwin, iowa. that\\'s 15 miles southeast of marshalltown, iowa. i\\'m getting a divorce at the present time. and i am at present in a mental institution in iowa city, iowa, which is 100 miles southeast of marshalltown, iowa.\"     perseveration is most commonly seen in organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.  personality. deeply ingrained patterns of behavior, which include the way one relates to, perceives, and thinks about the environment and oneself. personality traits are prominent aspects of personality, and do not imply pathology. personality disorder implies inflexible and maladaptive patterns of sufficient severity to cause either significant impairment in adaptive functioning or subjective distress.  phobia. a persistent, irrational fear of a specific object, activity, or situation that results in a compelling desire to avoid the dreaded object, activity, or situation (the phobic stimulus). more commonly, the individual does actually avoid the feared situation or object, though he or she recognizes that the fear is unreasonable and unwarranted by the actual dangerousness of the object, activity, or situation. some individuals with a phobia claim that their avoidance is rational because they anticipate overwhelming anxiety or some other strong emotion that is out of their control; they do not claim, however, that their anxiety is rationally justified.  poverty of content of speech. speech that is adequate in amount but conveys little information because of vagueness, empty repetitions, or use of stereotyped or obscure phrases. the interviewer may observe that the individual has spoken at some length but has not given adequate information to answer a question. alternatively, the individual may provide enough information to answer the question, but require many words to do so, so that his or her lengthy reply can be summarized in a sentence or two. the term poverty of content of speech is generally not used when the speech is, for the most part, not understandable (incoherence).     example: interviewer: \"ok. why is it, do you think, that people believe in god?\" patient: \"well, first of all because, he is the person that, is their personal savior. he walks with me and talks with me. and uh, the understanding that i have, a lot of peoples, they don\\'t really know their own personal self. because they ain\\'t, they all, just don\\'t know their own personal self. they don\\'t, know that he uh, seemed like to me, a lot of em don\\'t understand that he walks and talks with them. and uh, show \\'em their way to go. i understand also that, every man and every lady, is just not pointed in the same direction. some are pointed different. they go in their different ways. the way that jesus christ wanted \\'em to go. myself, i am pointed in the ways of uh, knowing right from wrong, and doing it. i can\\'t do any more, or not less, than that.\"                                         glossary of technical terms 367  poverty of speech. restriction in the amount of speech, so that spontaneous speech and replies to questions are brief and unelaborated. when the condition is marked, replies may be monosyllabic, and some questions may be unanswered.     poverty of speech occurs frequently in schizophrenia, major depressive episodes, and organic mental disorders, such as dementia.  pressure of speech. speech that is increased in amount, accelerated, and difficult or impossible to interrupt. usually it is also loud and emphatic. frequently, the individual talks without any social stimulation and may continue to talk even though no one is listening.     pressure of speech is most often seen in manic episodes, but may also occur in some cases of organic mental disorders, major depression with psychomotor agitation, schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and, occasionally, acute reactions to stress.  prodromal. early signs or symptoms of a disorder.  pseudodementia. clinical features resembling a dementia that are not due to organic brain dysfunction or disease. pseudodementia may occur in a major depressive episode or may be seen in factitious disorder with psychological symptoms.  psychomotor agitation. excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension; the activity is usually nonproductive and repetitious. when the agitation is severe, it may be accompanied by shouting or loud complaining. the term should be used in a technical sense to refer only to states of tension or restlessness that are accompanied by observable excessive motor activity. examples: inability to sit still, pacing, wringing of hands, pulling at clothes.  psychomotor retardation. visible generalized slowing down of physical reactions, movements, and speech.  psychotic. a term indicating gross impairment in reality testing. it may be used to describe the behavior of an individual at a given time, or a mental disorder in which at some time during its course all individuals with the disorder have grossly impaired reality testing. when there is gross impairment in reality  testing, the individual incorrectly evaluates the accuracy of his or her percep tions and thoughts and makes incorrect inferences about external reality, even in  the face of contrary evidence. the term psychotic does not apply to minor dis tortions of reality that involve matters of relative judgment. for example, a  depressed person who underestimated his achievements would not be described  as psychotic, whereas one who believed he had caused a natural catastrophe  would be so described.     direct evidence of psychotic behavior is the presence of either delusions or  hallucinations without insight into their pathological nature. the term psychotic  is sometimes appropriate when an individual\\'s behavior is so grossly disorga  368 appendix b  nized that a reasonable inference can be made that reality testing is disturbed. examples include markedly incoherent speech without apparent awareness by the person that the speech is not understandable, and the agitated, inattentive, and disoriented behavior seen in alcohol withdrawal delirium.     in dsm-ii the term psychotic was applied to individuals whose \"mental functioning [was] sufficiently impaired to interfere grossly with their capacity to meet the ordinary demands of life,\" whether or not there was impaired reality testing. this definition of psychotic did not conform to common usage, which generally limited use of the term to impairment in reality testing, as does the dsm-iii definition. as a result, the value of the term for communication was diminished, since it was then unclear whether or not an individual described as being psychotic had gross impairment in reality testing. it should also be noted that an individual with a nonpsychotic mental disorder may exhibit psychotic behavior, though rarely. for example, an individual with obsessive compulsive disorder may at times come to believe in the reality of the danger of being contaminated by shaking hands with strangers.     in dsm-iii the psychotic disorders include pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenic and paranoid disorders, psychotic disorders not elsewhere classified, some organic mental disorders, and some affective disorders.  residual. the phase of an illness that occurs after remission of the florid symptoms or the full syndrome. examples: the residual states of infantile autism, attention deficit disorder, and schizophrenia.  sign. an objective manifestation of a pathological condition. signs are observed by the examiner rather than reported by the individual.  symptom. a manifestation of a pathological condition. although in some uses of the term it is limited to subjective complaints, in common use \"symptom\" includes objective signs of pathological conditions as well.  syndrome. a grouping of symptoms that occur together and that constitute a recognizable condition. the term \"syndrome\" is less specific than \"disorder\" or \"disease.',\n",
