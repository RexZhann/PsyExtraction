',\n",
       "  'the latter group of disorders has less secure footing in this block than the former because it contains many disorders that are symptomatically similar to conditions classified in other blocks (f20 f29, f30 f39, f40 f49, f60 f69) and are known to occur without gross cerebral pathological change or dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'however, the growing evidence that a variety of cerebral and systemic diseases are causally related to the occurrence of such syndromes provides sufficient justification for their inclusion here in a clinically oriented classification. ',\n",

       "  'in assessing the presence or absence of a dementia, special care should be taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional factors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and general physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may account for failure to perform. ',\n",
       "  'dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning, and usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, such as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and toilet activities. ',\n",

', 'the development of this manual over the last five years has not gone unnoticed; in fact, it is remarkable how much interest (alarm, despair, excitement, joy) has been shown in successive drafts of this document. ', 'the reasons for this interest are many.     ', 'first of all, over the last decade there has been growing recognition of the importance of diagnosis for both clinical practice and research. ', 'clinicians and research investigators must have a common language with which to communicate about the disorders for which they have professional responsibility. ', 'planning a treatment program must begin with an accurate diagnostic assessment. ', 'the efficacy of various treatment modalities can be compared only if patient groups are described using diagnostic terms that are clearly defined.     ', 'secondly, from its very beginning, drafts of dsm-iii have been widely circulated for critical review and use by clinicians and investigators. ', 'this made them aware of the many fundamental ways in which dsm-iii differs from its predecessor, dsm-ii, and from its international contemporary, the mental disorders chapter of the ninth revision of the international classification of diseases (icd-9). ', 'for example, dsm-iii includes such new features as diagnostic criteria, a multiaxial approach to evaluation, much-expanded descriptions of the disorders and many additional categories (some with newly-coined names); and it does not include several time-honored categories.     ', 'finally, interest in the development of this manual is due to awareness that dsm-iii reflects an increased commitment in our field to reliance on data as the basis for understanding mental disorders.  ', \"background* the first edition of the american psychiatric association's diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders appeared in 1952. \", 'this was the first official manual of mental disorders to contain a glossary of descriptions of the diagnostic categories. ', 'the use of the term \"reaction\" throughout the classification reflected the influence of adolf meyer\\'s psychobiological view that mental disorders represented reactions of the personality to psychological, social, and biological factors. ', 'in the development of the second edition (dsm-ii), a decision was made to base the classification on the mental disorders section of the eighth revision of the international classification of diseases, for which representatives of the american psychiatric association had provided consultation. ', 'both dsm-ii and  * some readers may wish, for now, to skip background and the process of development of dsm-iii and plunge directly into basic concepts on p.5.                                 ', '1   2 introduction  icd-8 went into effect in 1968. ', 'the dsm-ii classification did not use the term \"reaction\" and used diagnostic terms that by and large did not imply a particular theoretical framework for understanding the nonorganic mental disorders.     ', 'in 1974 the american psychiatric association, through its council on research and development, appointed a task force on nomenclature and statistics to begin work on the development of dsm-iii, recognizing that icd-9 was scheduled to go into effect in january 1979. ', 'by the time this new task force was constituted, the mental disorders section of icd-9, which included its own glossary, was nearly completed. ', 'although representatives of the american psychiatric association had worked closely with the world health organization in the development of icd-9, there was some concern that the icd-9 classification and glossary would not be suitable for use in the united states. ', 'most importantly, many specific areas of the classification did not seem sufficiently detailed for clinical and research use. ', 'for example, the icd-9 classification contains only one category for \"frigidity and impotence\"—despite the substantial work in the area of psychosexual dysfunctions that has identified several specific types with different clinical pictures and treatment implications. ', 'in addition, the glossary of icd-9 was believed by many to be less than optimal in that it had not made use of such recent major methodological developments as specified diagnostic criteria and the multiaxial approach to evaluation.     ', 'for these reasons the task force was directed to prepare a new classification and glossary that would, as much as possible, reflect the most current state of knowledge regarding mental disorders while maintaining compatibility with icd-9. ', 'like its predecessors, dsm-i and dsm-ii, dsm-iii had to be, first of all, clinically useful, while also providing a basis for research and administrative use.      ', 'the task force. ', 'task force members, and consultants from the fields of psychology and epidemiology, were selected because of their special interest in various aspects of diagnosis. ', 'most had made significant contributions to the literature on diagnosis. ', 'as the work progressed, additional members were added to ensure representation of different perspectives and areas of expertise.     ', 'from the beginning, the task force functioned as a steering committee to oversee the ongoing work. ', 'all of its members shared a commitment to the attainment in dsm-iii of the following goals:   —clinical usefulness for making treatment and management decisions in varied     clinical settings;   —reliability of the diagnostic categories;   —acceptability to clinicians and researchers of varying theoretical orientations;   —usefulness for educating health professionals;   —maintaining compatibility with icd-9, except when departures are unavoid    able;   —avoiding the introduction of new terminology and concepts that break with     tradition, except when clearly needed;   —reaching consensus on the meaning of necessary diagnostic terms that have     been used inconsistently, and avoiding the use of terms that have outlived     their usefulness;   —consistency with data from research studies bearing on the validity of     diagnostic categories;                                                        introduction 3    —suitability for describing subjects in research studies;   —being responsive during the development of dsm-iii to critiques by clini    cians and researchers.     ', 'the major job of the task force has been to determine the most effective strategies for ensuring that the final document attained each goal to as great an extent as possible without compromising the other goals. ', 'thus, the task force evaluated all proposals for changes in dsm-iii that might affect the attainment of these goals. ', 'these proposals came from members of the task force, advisory committees, liaison committees with professional organizations, and participants in the dsm-iii field trials. ', 'finally, the task force reviewed drafts of the text and diagnostic criteria.     ', 'in attempting to resolve various diagnostic issues, the task force relied, as much as possible, on research evidence relevant to various kinds of diagnostic validity. ', 'for example, when discussing a problematic diagnostic category, the task force considered how the disorder, if defined as proposed, provided information relevant to treatment planning, course, and familial pattern. ', 'it should come as no surprise to the reader that even when data were available from relevant research studies, task force members often differed in their interpretations of the findings.      ', 'advisory committees and other consultants. ', 'successive drafts of dsm-iii were prepared by fourteen advisory committees composed of individuals with special expertise in each substantive area. ', 'in addition, a group of consultants provided advice and information on a variety of special areas.      ', 'council on research and development. ', 'this component of the american psychiatric association appointed the task force and regularly reviewed progress being made in the development of dsm-iii. ', 'in addition, in the fall of 1978 the council held an all-day meeting at which some apa members voiced concerns about certain aspects of dsm-iii. ', \"after reviewing these concerns, the council approved the task force's approach to solutions of the problems that had been raised.      \", 'assembly liaison committee. ', \"in early 1976, the apa assembly, composed of representatives from all of the apa's district branches, appointed a liaison committee to review the development of dsm-iii and to report regularly to the assembly. \", 'this committee received correspondence on major issues, reviewed successive drafts of dsm-iii, and met a number of times with the chairperson of the task force. ', 'on several occasions the assembly liaison committee arranged for the chairperson of the task force to discuss a particular controversial issue with the entire assembly. ', 'the assembly liaison committee was invaluable in articulating the concerns of the membership of the apa, which is compose largely of clinicians whose primary professional activity is patient care.      ', 'other components of the apa. ', 'the chairperson of the task force reported on several occasions to the reference committee and the board of trustees on specific issues of concern. ', 'in addition, in april 1979, a meeting was held with an   4 introduction  ad hoc committee on dsm-iii of the board of trustees to review specific concerns about dsm-iii that had been expressed by members of the apa. ', 'other components of the apa, such as the committee on confidentiality and the committee on women, also reviewed dsm-iii from their own perspectives as it was being developed.      ', 'liaison with other professional organizations. ', 'the following groups that were particularly interested in the development of dsm-iii established liaison committees with the task force: the academy of psychiatry and the law, the american academy of child psychiatry, the american academy of psychoanalysis, the american association of chairmen of departments of psychiatry, the american college health association, the american orthopsychiatric association, the american psychoanalytic association, and the american psychological association. ', 'these committees received drafts of dsm-iii and were invited to make comments and suggestions and to express their concerns. ', 'in most instances, differences in points of view between a liaison committee and the task force were resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned. ', 'when this was not possible and differences were left unresolved, the issues were at least clarified.  ', 'the process of development of dsm-iii in may 1975, at a special session of the annual meeting of the apa, an initial draft of the dsm-iii classification was presented. ', 'at each subsequent annual meeting a special session was held on some aspect of dsm-iii. ', 'in addition, a special conference was held in st. louis, missouri, in june 1976, to examine \"dsm-iii in midstream.\" this conference, co-sponsored by the missouri institute of psychiatry and the american psychiatric association, was attended by approximately 100 professionals with expertise or special interests in various aspects of dsm-iii, most of whom had previously had no direct involvement in the development of dsm-iii. ', 'as a result of discussions at this conference, additional diagnostic categories were added, some were deleted, and a decision was made to proceed with the development of the multiaxial system.     ', 'the dsm-iii classification and the rationale for the strategies used in its development have been presented throughout the past four years at local, national, and international professional meetings. ', 'in addition, the 4/15/77 draft and successive drafts of dsm-iii have been available to the profession for critical review. ', 'throughout this period there has been continual consideration of various solutions to difficult diagnostic problems, often based on summaries of actual cases submitted to the task force from all quarters. ', 'whenever possible, attempts have been made to seek the advice of experts in each specific area under consideration.      ', 'field trials. ', 'in the past, new classifications of mental disorders have not been extensively subjected to clinical trials before official adoption. ', 'the task force believed that field trials using drafts of dsm-iii should be conducted during the development process to identify problem areas in the classification and to try out solutions to these problems. ', 'in addition, because of the many proposed changes in the classification, it was important to demonstrate its clini                                                       introduction 5  cal acceptability and usefulness in a variety of settings by clinicians of varying theoretical orientations.     ', 'for these reasons, a series of field trials was conducted, beginning in 1977 and culminating in a two year nimh-sponsored field trial from september 1977 to september 1979. ', 'in all, 12,667 patients were evaluated by approximately 550 clinicians, 474 of whom were in 212 different facilities, using successive drafts of dsm-iii. ', 'critiques of all portions of dsm-iii by the field trial participants resulted in numerous changes, as did reviews of case summaries submitted by those participants. ', 'frequently, participants completed questionnaires regarding specific diagnostic issues and their attitudes toward dsm-iii and its innovative features. ', 'the results indicated that the great majority of participants, regardless of theoretical orientations, had a favorable response to dsm-iii.     ', 'perhaps the most important part of the study was the evaluation of diagnostic reliability by having pairs of clinicians make independent diagnostic judgments of several hundred patients. ', 'the results, which are presented in an appendix, generally indicate far greater reliability than had previously been obtained with dsm-ii.      ', 'icd-9-cm. ', 'because of dissatisfaction with icd-9 expressed by organizations representing subspecialties of medicine (not including the american psychiatric association), a decision was made to modify the icd-9 for use in the united states by expanding the four-digit icd-9 codes to five-digit icd-9-cm (for clinical modification) codes whenever greater specificity was required. ', 'this modification was prepared for the united states national center for health statistics by the council on clinical classifications. ', 'the american psychiatric association, in december 1976, was invited to submit recommendations for alternate names and additional categories based on subdivisions of already existing icd-9 categories. ', 'this made it possible for the developing dsm-iii classification and its diagnostic terms to be included in the icd-9-cm classification, which in january 1979 became the official system in this country for recording all \"diseases, injuries, impairments, symptoms, and causes of death.\" the icd9-cm codes and diagnostic terms for mental disorders are included in appendix ', 'd.     many icd-9-cm codes and terms are not included in the dsm-iii classification. ', 'however, these are generally acceptable to third party payers and most record-keeping systems.      ', 'final approval. ', 'in may 1979, at the annual meeting of the apa in chicago, the assembly and the council on research and development formally approved the final draft of dsm-iii. ', 'in june, it was approved by the reference committee and the board of trustees.  ', 'basic concepts mental disorder. ', 'although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, there is no satisfactory definition that specifies precise boundaries for the concept \"mental disorder\" ', '(also true for such concepts as physical disorder and   6 introduction  mental and physical health). ', 'nevertheless, it is useful to present concepts that have influenced the decision to include certain conditions in dsm-iii as mental disorders and to exclude others.     ', 'in dsm-iii each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is typically associated with either a painful symptom ', '(distress) ', 'or impairment in one or more important areas of functioning ', '(disability). ', 'in addition, there is an inference that there is a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction, and that the disturbance is not only in the relationship between the individual and society. ', '(when the disturbance is limited to a conflict between an individual and society, this may represent social deviance, which may or may not be commendable, but is not by itself a mental disorder.)     ', 'in dsm-iii there is no assumption that each mental disorder is a discrete entity with sharp boundaries ', '(discontinuity) ', 'between it and other mental disorders, as well as between it and no mental disorder. ', 'for example, there has been a continuing controversy as to whether or not severe depressive disorder and mild depressive disorder differ from each other qualitatively ', '(discontinuity between diagnostic entities) ', 'or quantitatively ', '(a difference on a severity continuum). ', 'the inclusion of major depression with and without melancholia as separate categories in dsm-iii is justified by the clinical usefulness of the distinction. ', 'this does not imply a resolution of the controversy as to whether or not these conditions are in fact quantitatively or qualitatively different.     ', 'a common misconception is that a classification of mental disorders classifies individuals, when actually what are being classified are disorders that individuals have. ', 'for this reason, the text of dsm-iii avoids the use of such phrases as \"a schizophrenic\" or \"an alcoholic,\" and instead uses the more accurate, but admittedly more wordy \"an individual with schizophrenia\" or \"an individual with alcohol dependence.\"     another misconception is that all individuals described as having the same mental disorder are alike in all important ways. ', 'although all the individuals described as having the same mental disorder show at least the defining features  of the disorder, they may well differ in other important ways that may affect clinical management and outcome.      ', 'conditions not attributable to a mental disorder. ', 'in dsm-iii it is recognized that a behavioral or psychological problem may appropriately be a focus of professional attention or treatment even though it is not attributable to a mental disorder. ', 'a limited listing of codes, taken from the v codes section of  icd-9-cm, is provided for noting such problems.      ', 'descriptive approach. ', 'for some of the mental disorders, the etiology or  pathophysiological processes are known. ', 'for example, in the organic mental  disorders, organic factors necessary for the development of the disorders have  been identified or are presumed. ', 'another example is adjustment disorder, in  which the disturbance is a reaction to psychosocial stress.      ', 'for most of the dsm-iii disorders, however, the etiology is unknown. ', 'a  variety of theories have been advanced, buttressed by evidence—not always                                                        introduction 7  convincing—to explain how these disorders come about. ', 'the approach taken in dsm-iii is atheoretical with regard to etiology or pathophysiological process except for those disorders for which this is well established and therefore included in the definition of the disorder. ', 'undoubtedly, with time, some of the disorders of unknown etiology will be found to have specific biological etiologies, others to have specific psychological causes, and still others to result mainly from a particular interplay of psychological, social and biological factors.     ', 'the major justification for the generally atheoretical approach taken in dsm-iii with regard to etiology is that the inclusion of etiological theories would be an obstacle to use of the manual by clinicians of varying theoretical orientations, since it would not be possible to present all reasonable etiological theories for each disorder. ', 'for example, phobic disorders are believed by many to represent a displacement of anxiety resulting from the breakdown of defensive operations for keeping internal conflict out of consciousness. ', 'other investigators explain phobias on the basis of learned avoidance responses to conditioned anxiety. ', 'still others believe that certain phobias result from a dysregulation of basic biological systems mediating separation anxiety. ', 'in any case, as the field trials have demonstrated, clinicians can agree on the identification of mental disorders on the basis of their clinical manifestations without agreeing on how the disturbances come about.     ', 'because dsm-iii is generally atheoretical with regard to etiology, it attempts to describe comprehensively what the manifestations of the mental disorders are, and only rarely attempts to account for how the disturbances come about, unless the mechanism is included in the definition of the disorder. ', 'this approach can be said to be \"descriptive\" in that the definitions of the disorders generally consist of descriptions of the clinical features of the disorders. ', 'these features are described at the lowest order of inference necessary to describe the characteristic features of the disorder. ', 'frequently the order of inference is relatively low, and the characteristic features consist of easily identifiable behavioral signs or symptoms, such as disorientation, mood disturbance, or psychomotor agitation. ', 'for some disorders, however, particularly the personality disorders, a much higher order of inference is necessary. ', 'for example, one of the criteria for borderline personality disorder is \"identity disturbance manifested by uncertainty about several issues relating to identity, such as self-image, gender identity, long-term goals or career choice, friendship patterns, values and loyalties.\"     this descriptive approach is also used in the division of the mental disorders into diagnostic classes. ', 'all of the disorders without known etiology or pathophysiological process are grouped together on the basis of shared clinical features.     ', 'the subdivision of each diagnostic class into specific disorders, with even further subdivision in some cases, reflects the best judgment of the task force and its advisory committees that such subdivision will be useful. ', 'in this regard we have been guided by the judgments of those clinicians who will be making most use of each portion of the classification. ', 'for example, the subdivision of psychosexual dysfunctions into seven specific disorders is in response to the expressed needs of clinicians who specialize in the treatment of these conditions. ', '(it soon became apparent that the criticism that a subdivision in a particular area of the classification was useless always came from clinicians who specialized   8 introduction  in other areas.) ', 'it should be noted, however, that the judgments of clinicians concerning the necessity for including new categories were not accepted uncritically. ', 'although initially many new categories were added in an effort to be inclusive, experience in the field trials and lack of validity evidence from the literature resulted in the elimination of several proposed categories.      ', 'diagnostic criteria. ', 'since in dsm-i, dsm-ii, and icd-9 explicit criteria are not provided, the clinician is largely on his or her own in defining the content and boundaries of the diagnostic categories. ', 'in contrast, dsm-iii provides specific diagnostic criteria as guides for making each diagnosis since such criteria enhance interjudge diagnostic reliability. ', 'it should be understood, however, that for most of the categories the diagnostic criteria are based on clinical judgment, and have not yet been fully validated by data about such important correlates as clinical course, outcome, family history, and treatment response. ', 'undoubtedly, with further study the criteria for many of the categories will be revised.      ', 'multiaxial evaluation. ', 'dsm-iii recommends the use of a multiaxial system for evaluation to ensure that certain information that may be of value in planning treatment and predicting outcome for each individual is recorded on each of five axes, the first three of which constitute an official diagnostic evaluation.     ', 'axes i and ii include all of the mental disorders. ', '(two classes of mental disorders, personality disorders and specific developmental disorders, are assigned to axis ii, whereas all of the other mental disorders are assigned to axis ', 'i. the reason for this is discussed on p. 23. this does not imply that these axis ii disorders are not mental disorders.', ')     ', 'axis iii is for physical disorders and conditions. ', 'the separation of this axis from the mental disorders axes, is based on the tradition of separating those disorders whose manifestations are primarily behavioral or psychological ', '(i.e., mental disorders) ', 'from those whose manifestations are not. ', 'it is necessary to have a term that can be applied to all of the disorders that are not considered \"mental disorders.\" the phrase \"organic disorder\" would incorrectly imply the absence of physical factors in \"mental\" disorders. ', 'hence, this manual uses the term \"physical disorder,\" recognizing that the boundaries for these two classes of disorders ', '(\"mental\" and \"physical\" disorders) ', 'change as our understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders increases.     ', 'axis iv, severity of psychosocial stressors and axis v, highest level of adaptive functioning past year, are for use in special clinical or research settings and provide information additional to the official dsm-iii diagnoses ', '(axes i, ii, and ', 'iii) ', 'that is of value for treatment planning and predicting outcome.      ', 'hierarchical organization of diagnostic classes. ', 'in some mental disorders, for example, organic mental disorders, there is a wide range of signs and symptoms. ', 'in others, such as anxiety disorders, only a limited range of signs and symptoms is seen. ', 'for this reason, the order in which diagnostic classes are listed represents, to some extent, a hierarchy in which a disorder high in the hierarchy may have features found in disorders lower in the hierarchy, but                                                         introduction 9   not the reverse. ', 'this hierarchical relationship makes it possible to present the  differential diagnosis of major symptom areas in a series of decision trees ', '(see  appendix ', 'a).      ', 'systematic description. ', 'the text of dsm-iii systematically describes each  disorder in terms of current knowledge in the following areas: essential features,  associated features, age at onset, course, impairment, complications, predisposing  factors, prevalence, sex ratio, familial pattern, and differential diagnosis. ', 'al though descriptively comprehensive, dsm-iii is not a textbook, since it does  not include information about theories of etiology, management and treatment.  ', 'it should also be noted that the dsm-iii classification of mental disorders does  not attempt to classify disturbed dyadic, family, or other interpersonal relation ships.       ', 'glossary of technical terms. ', 'technical terms used in the text for describing  the disorders are defined in a glossary in appendix ', 'b.      annotated comparative listing of dsm-ii and dsm-iii. ', 'the profession is  entitled to know the rationale for all of the major changes that have resulted in  the dsm-iii classification of mental disorders. ', 'for this reason, included in  appendix c is a table containing an explanation for each major change made  and new category added, with references from the scientific literature. ', 'with the  use of this table, the reader can more easily make the transition from the dsm-ii  to the dsm-iii classification and understand the reasons for the changes.   ', 'neurotic disorders throughout the development of dsm-iii the omission of the dsm-ii diagnostic class of neuroses has been a matter of great concern to many clinicians, and requires an explanation.     ', 'when freud first used the term \"psychoneurosis,\" he was referring to only four subtypes: anxiety neurosis, anxiety hysteria ', '(phobia), obsessive compulsive neurosis, and hysteria.

', 'at the present time, however, there is no consensus in our field as to how to define \"neurosis.\" some clinicians limit the term to its descriptive meaning whereas others also include the concept of a specific etiological process. ', 'to avoid ambiguity, the term neurotic disorder should be used only descriptively. ', 'this is consistent with the use of this term in icd-9. ', 'the term neurotic process, on the other hand, should be used when the clinician wishes to indicate the concept of a specific etiological process involving the following sequence: unconscious conflicts between opposing wishes or between wishes and prohibitions, which causes unconscious perception of anticipated danger or dysphoria, which leads to use of defense mechanisms that result in either symptoms, personality disturbance, or both.     ', 'the term neurotic disorder thus refers to a mental disorder in which the predominant disturbance is a symptom or group of symptoms that is distressing   10 introduction  to the individual and is recognized by him or her as unacceptable and alien ', '(ego-dystonic); reality testing is grossly intact; behavior does not actively violate gross social norms ', '(although functioning may be markedly impaired); the disturbance is relatively enduring or recurrent without treatment and is not limited to a transitory reaction to stressors; and there is no demonstrable organic etiology or factor.    ', 'although many psychodynamically-oriented clinicians believe that the neurotic process always plays a central role in the development of neurotic disorders, there are other theories about how these disorders develop. ', 'for example, there are social learning, cognitive, behavioral, and biological models that attempt to explain the development of various neurotic disorders.    ', 'thus, the term neurotic disorder is used in dsm-iii without any implication of a special etiological process. ', 'neurotic disorder, defined descriptively, is roughly equivalent to the psychoanalytic concept of \"symptom neurosis.\" ', '(this is distinguished from \"character neurosis\" which is roughly equivalent to the dsm-iii concept of personality disorder. according to modern psychoanalytic theory, the neurotic process is involved in the development of both symptom neuroses and character neuroses.)     ', 'in dsm-iii the neurotic disorders are included in affective, anxiety, somatoform, dissociative, and psychosexual disorders. ', 'these diagnostic classes are listed together in the dsm-iii classification to facilitate the location of neurotic disorders. ', 'preceding the listing of the class of affective disorders is a statement indicating that neurotic disorders are included in these five dsmiii classes.     ', 'it should be noted that the icd-9 category neurotic disorders, also defined descriptively, includes only those categories that historically have been included as \"neuroses\" in previous standard classifications. ', 'these previous classifications did not contain some of the dsm-iii categories, such as psychosexual disorders, that unquestionably include some disorders falling within the concept of neurotic disorders.     ', 'alternative approaches to the issue of the relationship of neurotic disorders to the dsm-iii classification were considered. ', 'if the dsm-iii classification had included a category of neurotic disorders that was limited to those disorders included in the icd-9 category, the potential value of the term neurotic disorder would have been limited by a lack of adherence to its descriptive meaning. ', 'on the other hand, to have grouped together all of the specific dsmiii categories that are usually considered to be neurotic disorders would have required separating some affective disorders from the other affective disorders, some psychosexual disorders from the other psychosexual disorders, and some dissociative disorders from other members of that class. ', 'the possible advantages of this approach seemed to be far outweighed by the disadvantage of fragmenting several diagnostic classes. ', 'similarly, it was judged unwise to group all psychotic disorders together, as is done in icd-9.

', 'a clinician considering family therapy will need information about how the presenting problem affects the \"identified patient\" and the other family members as individuals and as a social unit, how the family members relate to each other, and how they could more effectively provide mutual support in dealing with current and future problems. ', 'in addition, the clinician will want to know how the family fits into the broader social network, which includes the therapist  and other health-care providers, and how the family can make most effective use of these resources.

', '(this manual does not divide the organic brain syndromes into psychotic and nonpsychotic or acute and chronic [irreversible] forms, as have other classifications. whereas these distinctions were made on the basis of severity, mode of onset, and presumptions concerning prognosis, the present classification is based on clinical symptoms alone. delirium may, however, be said to be roughly equivalent to the dsm-i concept of acute brain syndrome, and dementia, to that of chronic brain syndrome.)  ', 'delirium the essential feature is a clouded state of consciousness, that is, a reduction in the clarity of awareness of the environment. ', 'this is manifested by difficulty in sustaining attention to both external and internal stimuli, sensory misperception, and a disordered stream of thought. ', 'in addition, disturbances of sleep-wakefulness and psychomotor activity are present. ', 'the onset is relatively rapid, and the course typically fluctuates. ', 'the total duration is usually brief.     ', 'in dsm-i this syndrome was called \"acute brain syndrome.\" it has also been termed \"acute exogenous reaction type,\" \"acute confusional state,\" \"toxic psychosis,\" and \"metabolic encephalopathy.\" furthermore, some reserve the term \"delirium\" for a particular, agitated variety of confusional state with vivid visual hallucinations. ', 'in this manual, however, delirium is intended to include the broad spectrum of clinical states having in common the essential features described above.     ', 'in delirium there is difficulty shifting, focusing, and sustaining attention. ', 'the individual is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli. ', 'it may be difficult, or impossible, to engage him or her in conversation because attention wanders.     ', 'perceptual disturbances are common and result in various misinterpretations, illusions, and hallucinations. ', 'for example, the banging of a door may be mistaken for a pistol shot ', '(misinterpretation); the folds of the bedclothes may appear to be animate objects ', '(illusion); or the individual may \"see\" a group of people hovering over the bed when no one is actually there ', '(hallucination). ', 'although sensory misperceptions and hallucinations are most commonly visual, they may occur in other sensory modalities as well. ', 'misperceptions range from simple and uniform to highly complex. ', 'there are often both a delusional conviction of the reality of hallucinations and an emotional and behavioral response in keeping with their content.     ', 'the individual with delirium cannot maintain a coherent stream of thought. ', 'thinking loses its usual clarity and direction toward a goal; it appears fragmented and disjointed. ', 'in mild delirium, this may be manifested by acceleration or slowing of thought; in severe delirium, thinking may be totally disorganized. ', 'this disturbance is reflected in speech that, in some cases, is limited and sparse, and in others, pressured and incoherent, with unpredictable switching                                          organic mental disorders 105  from subject to subject. ', 'it is also reflected in defective reasoning and impaired goal-directed behavior. ', 'perseveration of speech and behavior may appear. ', 'although other cognitive disturbances, particularly disorientation and memory impairment, are also present in delirium, the person may be so inattentive and incoherent that these mental functions cannot be meaningfully assessed.     ', 'the sleep-wakefulness cycle is almost invariably disturbed. ', 'this frequently involves some depression in the level of consciousness, ranging from simple drowsiness, through increasing stages of torpor, to stupor or semicoma. ', 'on the other hand, some individuals with delirium are hypervigilant and have difficulty in falling asleep. ', 'fluctuations from hypersomnolence to insomnia and reversals of the customary sleep-waking cycle may also be present. ', 'vivid dreams and nightmares are common, and may merge with hallucinations.     ', 'psychomotor activity is also disturbed. ', 'many individuals are restless and hyperactive. ', 'groping or picking at the bedclothes, attempting to get out of bed, striking out at nonexistent objects, and sudden changes of position are manifestations of increased psychomotor activity. ', 'on the other hand, there may be decreased psychomotor activity, with sluggishness and even certain features resembling catatonic stupor. ', 'psychomotor activity often shifts abruptly from one of these extremes to another.      ', 'associated features. ', 'emotional disturbances are very common and quite variable. ', 'they include anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy. ', 'some individuals maintain the same emotional tone throughout the course of the delirium whereas others experience rapid and unpredictable changes from one emotional state to another. ', 'fear is very commonly experienced, sometimes as the result of threatening hallucinations or poorly systematized delusions. ', 'if fear is marked, the individual may attempt to flee his or her surroundings without regard to possible injury, or may attack those who are falsely viewed as threatening. ', 'severely depressed feelings may also lead to selfdestructive acts. ', 'crying, calls for help, cursing, muttering, moaning, and other vocal productions, particularly prominent at night, are further manifestations of the disturbed emotional state of individuals with delirium.     ', 'neurological signs are comparatively uncommon in delirium. ', 'an important exception, however, is the presence of abnormal movements. ', 'various forms of tremor are frequently present. ', 'asterixis, a peculiar flapping movement of the hyperextended hands, was originally described in hepatic encephalopathy, but may be found in other delirious states as well. ', 'autonomic signs ', '(tachycardia, sweating, flushed face, dilated pupils, and elevated blood pressure) ', 'commonly occur.

', 'sometimes it begins quite abruptly, ', 'e.g.', ', after a head injury or following a seizure. ', 'at other   106 diagnostic categories  times it is preceded, for hours or days, by certain prodromal symptoms. ', 'these include restlessness, difficulty in thinking clearly, hypersensitivity to auditory and visual stimuli, nocturnal insomnia, daytime hypersomnolence, vivid dreams, and nightmares. ', 'the slower evolution is more likely if systemic illness or metabolic imbalance underlies the delirium.     ', 'fluctuation in symptoms is one of the hallmarks of delirium. ', 'typically, the individual is worse during sleepless nights or in the dark. ', 'so-called \"lucid intervals/\\' periods during which he or she is more attentive and coherent, may occur at any time, but are most common in the morning. ', 'these fluctuations help distinguish delirium from other brain syndromes.     ', 'the duration of an episode of delirium is usually brief, about one week; it is rare for delirium to persist for more than a month. ', 'if the underlying disorder is promptly corrected or is self-limited, recovery from delirium may be complete. ', 'on the other hand, if the underlying disorder persists, the clinical syndrome of delirium gradually shifts to some other, more stable, organic brain syndrome, or may cause death.      ', 'complications. ', 'injuries may be sustained from falling out of bed or attempting to flee frightening hallucinations. ', 'agitation may interfere with proper medical management. ', 'if inadequately or belatedly treated, delirium may lead to a dementia or, more rarely, an amnestic syndrome or organic personality syndrome.      ', 'etiological factors. ', 'the causes of delirium usually lie outside the nervous system and include: systemic infections; metabolic disorders such as hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia, ionic imbalances, hepatic or renal disease, or thiamine deficiency; postoperative states; and substance intoxication and withdrawal. ', 'delirium also occurs in hypertensive encephalopathy, following seizures, and on regaining consciousness after head trauma.

', 'schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and other psychotic disorders may also be marked by hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking and speech. ', 'in delirium, however, these symptoms are extremely random and haphazard, without evidence of systematization.

', \"finally, in delirium there is often a generalized slowing of background activity in the electroencephalogram, and the syndrome's cause is obviously organic.      \", 'whereas dementia involves a global cognitive deficit occurring in a normal state of consciousness, delirium is basically a clouded state of consciousness.                                           ', 'organic mental disorders 107   often, however, the two syndromes coexist in the same individual, and it may  be difficult to decide how much of the clinical picture to ascribe to one syndrome  and how much to the other. ', 'one cannot diagnose dementia in the presence of  significant delirium, because the symptoms of delirium interfere with the proper  assessment of dementia. ', 'only a definite history of pre-existing dementia allows  one to decide that an individual with delirium also has dementia. ', 'when there  is uncertainty as to whether the symptoms in a given individual are basically  those of delirium or dementia, it is best to make a provisional diagnosis of  delirium.

', 'factitious disorder with psychological symptoms simulating an organic  brain syndrome might, under rare circumstances, present a problem in the dif ferential diagnosis of delirium.

', 'the reversibility of a dementia is a function of the underlying pathology and of the availability and timely application of effective treatment.     ', 'memory impairment is usually the most prominent symptom. ', 'in mild dementia there is forgetfulness in daily life and a need to have statements repeated several times to facilitate remembering. ', 'on examination there may only be a certain hesitancy in response to questions. ', 'in more severe memory impairment, the individual may forget names, telephone numbers, directions, conversations, and events of the day. ', 'he or she may leave tasks unfinished because of forgetting to return after an interruption. ', 'this may cause a person to leave the water running in the sink or to neglect turning off the stove. ', 'in advanced forms of dementia, memory impairment is often so severe that the person forgets the names of close relatives, his or her own occupation, schooling, birthday, or, occasionally, even his or her own name. ', 'memory disturbance may be formally documented by demonstrating difficulty in learning new information ', '(short-term memory deficit) ', 'and in recalling material that was known in the past ', '(long-term memory deficit). ', 'the former is tested by asking the individual to memorize the names of several unrelated objects, or a brief sentence, and then to repeat them after a few minutes of distraction; the latter is tested by asking about events that happened in the past.     ', 'impairment of abstract thinking takes many forms. ', 'the individual has trouble coping with novel tasks, especially if pressed for time. ', 'he or she may try to avoid situations and tasks that require the processing of new and complex information. ', 'this deficit is sometimes formally assessed by asking the individual to interpret proverbs or to perform such tasks as finding similarities or differences between related words. ', 'the individual with dementia interprets proverbs concretely and has difficulty in finding similarities or differences.     ', 'impaired judgment and impulse control are also commonly observed. ', 'coarse language, inappropriate jokes, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, and a general disregard for the conventional rules of social conduct are evidence of bad judgment and poor impulse control.

', 'agnosias ', '(failure to recognize or identify objects despite intact sensory function) ', 'and apraxias ', '(inability to carry out motor activities despite intact comprehension and motor function) ', 'may also be present.     ', 'personality change is almost invariably present in dementia, and may involve either an alteration or an accentuation of premorbid traits. ', 'a common pattern is for a normally active individual to become increasingly apathetic and withdrawn. ', 'the range of social involvement narrows.

', 'when dementia is mild and the individual has some grasp of his or her deteriorating faculties, he or she may react with marked anxiety or depression. ', 'attempts to conceal or compensate for subjectively perceived intellectual deficits are very common. ', 'this may result in excessive orderliness, social withdrawal, or a tendency to relate events in excessive detail so as to avoid exposure of gaps in memory.

', 'with further intoxication, however, the individual may slow down and become depressed, withdrawn, and dull, and even lose consciousness.     ', 'the duration of an episode of alcohol intoxication depends on a variety of factors, including the amount and type of alcoholic beverage consumed, how rapidly it was ingested, and whether or not it was taken with food.

', 'the difficulty in giving up tobacco use on a long-term basis, particularly with cigarettes, may be due to the unpleasant nature of the withdrawal syndrome, the highly overlearned nature of the habit that stems from the repeated effects of nicotine, which rapidly follow the inhalation of cigarette smoke ', '(75,000 puffs per year for a pack-a-day smoker), and the likelihood that a desire to use tobacco is elicited by environmental cues, such as the ubiquitous presence of other smokers and the widespread availability of cigarettes.

', 'it should be noted that no single feature is invariably present or seen only in schizophrenia.      ', 'content of thought. ', 'the major disturbance in the content of thought involves delusions that are often multiple, fragmented, or bizarre ', '(i.e., patently absurd, with no possible basis in fact). ', 'simple persecutory delusions involving the belief that others are spying on, spreading false rumors about, or planning harm to the individual are common. ', 'delusions of reference, in which events, objects, or other people are given particular and unusual significance, usually of a negative or pejorative nature, are also common. ', 'for example, the individual may be convinced that a television commentator is mocking him.     ', 'certain delusions are far more common in this disorder than in other psychotic disorders. ', \"these include, for instance, the belief or experience that one's thoughts, as they occur, are broadcast from one's head to the external world so that others can hear them \", \"(thought broadcasting); that thoughts that are not one's own are inserted into one's mind \", \"(thought insertion); that thoughts have been removed from one's head \", \"(thought withdrawal); or that one's feelings, impulses, thoughts, or actions are not one's own but are imposed by some external force \", '(delusions of being controlled). ', 'less commonly, somatic, gran diose, religious, and nihilistic delusions are seen. ', 'overvalued ideas may occur  ', '(e.g., preoccupation with the special significance of certain dietary habits), or markedly illogical thinking ', '(e.g., thinking that contains clear internal contra dictions or in which conclusions are reached that are clearly erroneous, given the  initial premises).       ', 'form of thought. ', 'a disturbance in the form of thought is often present.  ', 'this has been referred to as \"formal thought disorder,\" and is distinguished  from a disorder in the content of thought. ', 'the most common example of this is  loosening of associations, in which ideas shift from one subject to another com pletely unrelated or only obliquely related subject, without the speaker showing  any awareness that the topics are unconnected. ', 'statements that lack a meaning ful relationship may be juxtaposed, or the individual may shift idiosyncratically  from one frame of reference to another. ', 'when loosening of associations is  severe, incoherence may occur, that is, speech may become incomprehensible.  ', 'there may also be poverty of content of speech, in which speech is adequate  in amount but conveys little information because it is vague, overly abstract or  overly concrete, repetitive, or stereotyped. ', 'the listener can recognize this dis turbance by noting that little if any information has been conveyed although  the individual has spoken at some length. ', 'less common disturbances include  neologisms, perseveration, clanging, and blocking.       ', 'perception. ', 'the major disturbances in perception are various forms of  hallucination. ', 'although these occur in all modalities, by far the most common  are auditory, frequently involving voices the individual perceives as coming                                            schizophrenic disorders 183  from outside the head.

', 'voices speaking directly to the individual or commenting on his or her ongoing behavior are particularly characteristic. ', 'command hallucinations may be obeyed, at times creating danger for the individual or others. ', 'occasionally, the auditory hallucinations are of sounds rather than voices. ', 'tactile hallucinations may be present, and typically involve electrical, tingling, or burning sensations. ', 'somatic hallucinations, such as the sensation of snakes crawling inside the abdomen, are occasionally experienced. ', 'visual, gustatory, and olfactory hallucinations also occur, but with less frequency, and, in the absence of auditory hallucinations, always raise the possibility of an organic mental disorder.     ', 'other perceptual abnormalities include sensations of bodily change and hypersensitivity to sound, sight, and smell.      ', 'affect. ', 'the disturbance often involves blunting, flattening, or inappropriateness of affect. ', 'in blunted affect there is severe reduction in the intensity of affective expression. ', 'in flat affect there are virtually no signs of affective expression; the voice is usually monotonous and the face, immobile. ', 'the individual may complain that he or she no longer responds with normal emotional intensity or, in extreme cases, no longer has feelings. ', \"in inappropriate af fect, the affect is clearly discordant with the content of the individual's speech  or ideation. \", 'for example, while discussing being tortured by electrical shocks,  an individual with schizophrenia, paranoid type, laughs or smiles. ', 'sudden and  unpredictable changes in affect involving inexplicable outbursts of anger may occur.     ', 'although these affective disturbances are almost invariably present, their usefulness in making the diagnosis is limited because their presence is often  difficult to judge except when present in extreme form. ', 'furthermore, the antipsychotic drugs have effects that may appear similar to the affective blunting  and flattening seen in schizophrenia.       ', 'sense of self. ', 'the sense of self that gives the normal person a feeling of  individuality, uniqueness, and self-direction is frequently disturbed.

', 'schizophrenic disorders 185      during the active phase psychotic symptoms—e.g., delusions, hallucinations, loosening of associations, incoherence, poverty of content of speech, markedly illogical thinking, and behavior that is grossly disorganized or catatonic—are prominent.

', 'the onset of the active phase, either initially or as an exacerbation of a preexisting active phase, is often associated with a psychosocial stressor.     ', 'usually a residual phase follows the active phase of the illness. ', 'the clinical picture of this phase is similar to that of the prodromal phase, although affective blunting or flattening and impairment in role functioning tend to be more common in the residual phase. ', 'during the residual phase some of the psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, may persist, but are no longer accompanied by strong affect.     ', 'a complete return to premorbid functioning is unusual—so rare, in fact, that some clinicians would question the diagnosis. ', 'however, there is always the possibility of full remission or recovery, although its frequency is unknown. ', 'the most common course is one of acute exacerbations with increasing residual impairment between episodes.     ', 'numerous studies have indicated a group of factors associated with good prognosis: absence of premorbid personality disturbance, adequate premorbid social functioning, precipitating events, abrupt onset, onset in mid-life, a clinical picture that involves confusion, and a family history of affective disorder.     ', 'because a knowledge of course is very important for planning treatment, and because differences in course may reflect fundamental differences among schizophrenic disorders, a separate digit is provided for coding the course as subchronic, chronic, subchronic with acute exacerbation, chronic with acute exacerbation, or in remission ', '(for criteria, see p. 192).

', 'impairment. ', 'invariably there is impairment in several areas of routine daily functioning, such as work, social relations, and self-care. ', 'supervision may be required to ensure that nutritional and hygienic needs are met and to protect the individual from the consequences of poor judgment, cognitive impairment, or actions based on delusions or in response to hallucinations.

', 'the diagnosis is made more commonly among the lower socioeconomic groups. ', 'the reasons for this are unclear, but may involve downward social drift, lack of upward socioeconomic mobility, and high stress.     ', 'certain patterns of family interaction have been hypothesized as predisposing to the development, onset, relapse or chronicity of schizophrenia. ', 'the interpretation of the evidence supporting these hypotheses is controversial.      ', 'prevalence. ', 'studies in europe and asia, using a relatively narrow concept  of schizophrenia, have found a lifetime prevalence rate of from 0.2% to almost  1%.

', 'this includes studies in which the adopted  offspring of individuals with schizophrenia have been reared by parents who  do not have schizophrenia. ', 'twin studies consistently show a higher concordance  rate of schizophrenia for monozygotic than dizygotic twins, and dizygotic twins  have the same concordance rate as siblings who are not twins. ', 'however, being  a monozygotic twin does not in itself predispose to the development of schizo phrenia. ', 'although genetic factors have been proven to be involved in the  development of the illness, the existence of a substantial discordance rate, even  in monozygotic twins, indicates the importance of nongenetic factors.       ', 'differential diagnosis. ', 'organic mental disorders often present with symp toms that suggest schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, incoherence,  and blunted or inappropriate affect. ', 'in particular, organic delusional syn dromes, such as those due to amphetamines or phencyclidine, may cross sectionally be identical in symptomatology with schizophrenia. ', 'even though an  active phase of schizophrenia may begin with confusion, the presence of dis orientation or memory impairment strongly suggests an organic mental dis order. ', '(of course, it is possible for an individual with schizophrenia to have a  superimposed organic mental disorder.)                                            ', 'schizophrenic disorders 187      paranoid disorders are distinguished from schizophrenia by the absence of prominent hallucinations, incoherence, loosening of associations, or bizarre delusions, such as delusions of being controlled or thought broadcasting.     ', 'in affective disorders there often are withdrawal and deterioration in functioning. ', 'these should not be mistaken for prodromal signs of schizophrenia. ', 'in affective disorders the development of delusions or hallucinations follows a period of affective disturbance. ', 'for this reason the diagnosis of schizophrenia is not made unless an affective syndrome, if present, developed after any psychotic symptoms or was brief in duration relative to the duration of the characteristic psychotic symptoms. ', 'the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia from the psychotic forms of the affective disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, is of special importance because of the different long-term treatment implications. ', 'a manic episode with anger and paranoid delusions needs to be distinguished from schizophrenia, paranoid type. ', 'however, an atypical affective disorder or adjustment disorder with depressed mood may be superimposed on schizophrenia, residual type. ', \"an example would be an individual with schizophrenia, residual type, chronic, who could develop a major depressive episode of several months' duration without any psychotic symptoms. \", 'in such a case both schizophrenia and atypical depression should be diagnosed.     ', 'the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder should be made whenever the clinician is unable to make a differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and affective disorder. ', 'although no criteria for schizoaffective disorder are provided in this manual, several examples of clinical situations in which this diagnosis might be appropriate are given on p. 202.     ', 'in schizophreniform disorder, by definition the duration of the illness is less than six months. ', 'the cross-sectional symptom picture may be indistinguishable from schizophrenia, but emotional turmoil and confusion are more likely to occur in schizophreniform disorder. ', 'it should be noted that the six-month duration of illness required for schizophrenia refers to a continuous period of illness. ', 'thus, an individual with several episodes of schizophreniform disorder from each of which there has been full recovery would not be diagnosed as having schizophrenia merely because the total period of illness exceeded six months.     ', 'atypical psychosis is diagnosed when there is a nonaffective psychotic disorder but there is insufficient information to make a diagnosis of schizophrenia. ', 'it is also diagnosed in those unusual instances in which one of the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia such as an encapsulated delusion of bodily change is present, but there is apparently no deterioration from a previous level of functioning.     ', 'in a pervasive developmental disorder, the cross-sectional picture, particularly of the residual state, may resemble schizophrenia, residual type. ', 'however, there is no history of delusions, hallucinations, or incoherence.     ', 'in obsessive compulsive disorder, hypochondriasis, and more rarely phobic disorder, in order to account for the symptoms the individual may develop overvalued ideas that are difficult to distinguish from delusions.

', 'however, a return within hours or days to the usual level of functioning distinguishes these disorders from schizophrenia.

                         appendix b:           glossary of technical terms   dsm-iii, by and large, includes only those technical terms that are essential for differential diagnosis; thus, many important terms relevant to psychopathology are omitted. this glossary of technical terms is limited to those that are used in either the descriptions and definitions or the diagnostic criteria of dsm-iii and that are associated with a number of mental disorders. for example, bulimia is not in this glossary because it is rarely encountered except among eating disorders, and the reader wishing to learn about this symptom should refer to the text on those disorders. on the other hand, such symptoms as delusions, phobias, obsessions, and depersonalization are included because they all occur in a number of mental disorders.     many of the entries list the disorders in which the symptom most frequently occurs; it should be understood, however, that the symptom may also be present in other disorders.  affect. an immediately expressed and observed emotion. a feeling state becomes an affect when it is observable, for example, as overall demeanor or tone and modulation of voice. affect is to be distinguished from mood, which refers to a pervasive and sustained emotion. affect is to mood as weather is to climate. common examples of affect are euphoria, anger, and sadness.     a range of affect may be described as broad (normal), restricted (constricted), blunted, or flat. what is considered the normal range of the expression of affect varies considerably, both within and among different cultures. the normal expression of affect involves variability in facial expression, pitch of voice, and the use of hand and body movements. restricted affect is characterized by a clear reduction in the expressive range and intensity of affects. blunted affect is marked by a severe reduction in the intensity of affective expression. in flat affect there is a lack of signs of affective expression; the voice may be monotonous and the face, immobile.     affect is inappropriate when it is clearly discordant with the content of the person\\'s speech or ideation. example: a patient smiled and laughed while discussing demons who were persecuting him. an affect should not be termed inappropriate, however, when it is inappropriate merely to the situation, such as laughing when told that a relative has died; in such instances it would be more apt to refer to inappropriate behavior.     affect is labile when it is characterized by repeated, rapid, and abrupt shifts. examples: an elderly man is tearful one moment and combative the next; a young woman is observed by her friends to be friendly, gregarious, and happy one moment and angry and abusive the next, without readily apparent reason.                                  353   354 appendix b  agitation. see psychomotor agitation.  anxiety. apprehension, tension, or uneasiness that stems from the anticipation of danger, which may be internal or external. some definitions of anxiety distinguish it from fear by limiting it to the anticipation of danger, the source of which is largely unknown, whereas fear is the response to a consciously recognized and usually external threat or danger. the manifestations of anxiety and fear are the same and include motor tension, autonomic hyperactivity, apprehensive expectation, and vigilance and scanning.     anxiety may be focused on an object, situation, or activity which is avoided (phobia), or may be unfocused (free-floating anxiety). it may be experienced in discrete periods of sudden onset and be accompanied by physical symptoms (panic attacks). when anxiety is focused on physical signs or symptoms and causes preoccupation with the fear or belief of having a disease, it is termed hypochondriasis.  attention. the ability to focus in a sustained manner on one task or activity. a disturbance in attention may be manifested by difficulty in finishing tasks that have been started, easy distractibility, and/or difficulty in concentrating on work.  blocking. interruption of a train of speech before a thought or idea has been completed. after a period of silence, which may last from a few seconds to minutes, the person indicates that he or she cannot recall what he or she has been saying or meant to say. blocking should be judged to be present only if the person spontaneously describes losing his or her thought or if upon questioning by the interviewer, the person gives that as the reason for pausing.  catatonic behavior. marked motor anomalies, generally limited to disturbances in the context of a diagnosis of a non-organic psychotic disorder.          catatonic excitement. excited motor activity, apparently purposeless     and not influenced by external stimuli.          catatonic negativism. an apparently motiveless resistance to all in    structions or attempts to be moved. when passive, the person may resist     any effort to be moved; when active, he or she may do the opposite of     what is asked—for example, firmly clench jaws when asked to open mouth.          catatonic rigidity. maintenance of a rigid posture against all efforts to     be moved.          catatonic posturing. voluntary assumption of an inappropriate or     bizarre posture, usually held for a long period of time. example: a patient     may stand with arms outstretched as if he were jesus on the cross.          catatonic stupor. marked decrease in reactivity to environment and                                        glossary of technical terms 355      reduction in spontaneous movements and activity, sometimes to the point of     appearing to be unaware of one\\'s surroundings.          catatonic waxy flexibility. the person\\'s limbs can be \"molded\" into     any position, which is then maintained. when the limb is being moved, it     feels to the examiner as if it were made of pliable wax.  circumstantiality. a term used to describe speech that is indirect and delayed in reaching the point because of unnecessary, tedious details, and parenthetic remarks. circumstantial replies or statements may be prolonged for many minutes if the speaker is not interrupted and urged to get to the point. interviewers often respond to circumstantiality by interrupting the speaker in order to complete the process of history taking within an allotted time. this may make it difficult to distinguish loosening of associations from circumstantiality. in the former there is a lack of connection between clauses, but in the latter the clauses always retain a meaningful connection. in loosening of associations the original point is lost, whereas in circumstantiality the speaker is always aware of the original point, goal, or topic.     circumstantiality is common in compulsive personality disorder and in many people without mental disorder.  clanging. speech in which sounds, rather than meaningful, conceptual relationships govern word choice; it may include rhyming and punning. the term is usually applied only when it is a manifestation of a pathological condition; thus, it would not be used to describe the rhyming word play of children. example: \"i\\'m not trying to make noise. ', \"i'm trying to make sense. \", 'if you can make sense out of nonsense, well, have fun. ', \"i'm trying to make sense out of sense. \", \"i'm not making sense (cents) anymore. \", 'i have to make dollars.', '\"     clanging is observed most commonly in schizophrenia and manic episodes.  compulsion. repetitive and seemingly purposeful behavior that is performed according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion. the behavior is not an end in itself, but is designed to produce or prevent some future state of affairs; the activity, however, either is not connected in a realistic way with the state of affairs it is designed to produce or prevent, or it may be clearly excessive. the act is performed with a sense of subjective compulsion coupled with a desire to resist it (at least initially); performing the particular act is not pleasurable, although it may afford some relief of tension. example: an individual feels compelled to wash his or her hands, every time he or she shakes hands because of a fear of contamination that he or she recognizes as excessive.     compulsions are characteristic of obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be seen in schizophrenia.  confabulation. fabrication of facts or events in response to questions about situations or events that are not recalled because of memory impairment. it differs from lying in that the individual is not consciously attempting to deceive.     confabulation is common in organic amnestic syndrome.   356 appendix b  conversion symptom. a loss or alteration of physical functioning that suggests a physical disorder but that is actually a direct expression of a psychological conflict or need. the disturbance is not under voluntary control, and is not explained by any physical disorder (this possibility having been excluded by appropriate investigation).     conversion symptoms are observed in conversion disorder, and may occur in schizophrenia.  delusion. a false personal belief based on incorrect inference about external reality and firmly sustained in spite of what almost everyone else believes and in spite of what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. the belief is not one ordinarily accepted by other members of the person\\'s culture or subculture (i.e., it is not an article of religious faith).     when a false belief involves an extreme value judgment, it is regarded as a delusion only when the judgment is so extreme as to defy credibility. example: if someone claims he or she is terrible and has disappointed his or her family, this is generally not regarded as a delusion even if an objective assessment of the situation would lead observers to think otherwise; but if someone claims he or she is the worst sinner in the world, this would generally be considered a delusional conviction. similarly, a person judged by most people to be moderately underweight who asserted he or she was fat would not be regarded as delusional; but one with anorexia nervosa who at the point of extreme emaciation insisted he or she was fat could rightly be considered delusional.     a delusion should be distinguished from a hallucination, which is a false sensory perception (although a hallucination may give rise to the delusion that the perception is true). a delusion is also to be distinguished from an overvalued idea, in which an unreasonable belief or idea is not as firmly held as is the case with a delusion.     delusions are subdivided according to their content. some of the more common types are listed below.          delusion of being controlled. a delusion in which feelings, impulses,     thoughts, or actions are experienced as being not one\\'s own, as being     imposed by some external force. this does not include the mere con    viction that one is acting as an agent of god, has had a curse placed on     him or her, is the victim of fate, or is not sufficiently assertive. the symp    tom should be judged present only when the subject experiences his or her     will, thoughts, or feelings as operating under some external force. examples:     a man claimed that his words were not his own, but those of his father;     a student believed that his actions were under the control of a yogi; a house    wife believed that sexual feelings were being put into her body from with    out.          delusion, bizarre. a false belief whose content is patently absurd and     has no possible basis in fact. example: a man believed that when his     adenoids had been removed in childhood, a box had been inserted into his                                     glossary of technical terms 357   head, and that wires had been placed in his head so that the voice he heard  was that of the governor.       delusion, grandiose. a delusion whose content involves an exaggerated  sense of one\\'s importance, power, knowledge, or identity. it may have a  religious, somatic, or other theme.       delusional jealousy. the delusion that one\\'s sexual partner is un faithful.       delusion, mood-congruent. see mood-congruent psychotic features.       delusion, mood-incongruent. see mood-incongruent psychotic features.       delusion, nihilistic. a delusion involving the theme of non-existence  of the self or part of the self, others, or the world. examples: \"the world  is finished\"; \"i no longer have a brain\"; \"there is no need to eat, because  i have no insides.', '\" a somatic delusion may also be a nihilistic delusion if  the emphasis is on nonexistence of the body or a part of the body.       delusion, persecutory. a delusion in which the central theme is that  a person or group is being attacked, harassed, cheated, persecuted, or  conspired against. usually the subject or someone or some group or institu tion close to him or her is singled out as the object of the persecution.      it is recommended that the term \"paranoid delusion\" not be used,  because its meanings are multiple, confusing, and contradictory. it has  often been employed to refer to both persecutory and grandiose delusions  because of their presence in the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia.       delusion of poverty. a delusion that the person is, or will be, bereft  of all, or virtually all, material possessions.       delusion of reference. a delusion whose theme is that events, objects,  or other people in the person\\'s immediate environment have a particular and  unusual significance, usually of a negative or pejorative nature. this differs from an idea of reference, in which the false belief is not as firmly  held as in a delusion. if the delusion of reference involves a persecutory  theme, then a delusion of persecution is present as well. examples: a woman was convinced that programs on the radio were directed espe cially to her; when recipes were broadcast, it was to tell her to prepare  wholesome food for her child and stop feeding her candy; when dance  music was broadcast, it was to tell her to stop what she was doing and  start dancing, and perhaps even to resume ballet lessons. a patient notes  that the room number of his therapist\\'s office is the same as the number of  the hospital room in which his father died and feels that this means there  is a plot to kill him.   358 appendix b          delusion, somatic. a delusion whose main content pertains to the     functioning of one\\'s body. examples: one\\'s brain is rotting; one is pregnant     despite being postmenopausal.         extreme value judgments about the body may, under certain circum    stances, also be considered somatic delusions. example: a person insists     that his nose is grossly misshaped despite lack of confirmation of this     by observers.         hypochondriacal delusions are also somatic delusions when they in    volve specific changes in the functioning or structure of the body rather     than merely an insistent belief that one has a disease.          delusions, systematized. a single delusion with multiple elaborations     or a group of delusions that are all related by the individual to a single     event or theme. example: a man who failed his bar examination developed     the delusion that this occurred because of a conspiracy involving the uni    versity and the bar association. he then attributed all other difficulties in     his social and occupational life to this continuing conspiracy.  depersonalization. an alteration in the perception or experience of the self so that the feeling of one\\'s own reality is temporarily lost. this is manifested in a sense of self-estrangement or unreality, which may include the feeling that one\\'s extremities have changed in size, or a sense of seeming to perceive oneself from a distance (usually from above).     depersonalization is seen in depersonalization disorder, and may also occur in schizotypal personality disorder^ and schizophrenia. it also occurs in the absence of any mental disorder in the presence of overwhelming anxiety, stress or fatigue.  diagnosis. in general usage, and in dsm-iii, this term refers to the process of identifying specific mental or physical disorders. some, however, use the term more broadly to refer to a comprehensive evaluation that is not limited to the identification of specific disorders. thus in the limited sense of the term, only axes i, ii and iii are diagnostic, whereas in the broader sense, axes iv and v and other aspects of assessment can also be considered diagnostic.  disorientation. confusion about the date or time of day, where one is (place), or who one is (identity).     disorientation is characteristic of some organic mental disorders, such as delirium and dementia.  distractibility. attention drawn too frequently to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli. example: while being interviewed, a subject\\'s attention is repeatedly drawn to noise from an adjoining office, a book that is on a shelf, or the interviewer\\'s school ring.  echolalia. repetition (echoing) of the words or phrases of others. typical                                         glossary of technical terms 359  echolalia tends to be repetitive and persistent. the echo is often uttered with a mocking, mumbling, or staccato intonation. echolalia should not be confused with habitual repetition of questions, apparently to clarify the question and formulate its answer, as when a patient is asked, \"when did you come to the hospital?\" and replies, \"come to the hospital? ', 'yesterday.', '\"     example: an interviewer says to a subject, \"i\\'d like to talk with you for a few minutes\"; and the subject responds, in a mumbling tone, \"talk with you for a few minutes. ', 'talk with you for a few minutes.', '\"     echolalia is observed in some pervasive developmental disorders, organic mental disorders, and in schizophrenia.  ego-dystonic. a symptom or personality trait that is recognized by the individual as unacceptable and undesirable and is experienced as alien. examples: obsessions and compulsions; a homosexual arousal pattern that is unacceptable to the individual would be ego-dystonic, whereas, if the individual were not distressed by the pattern and experienced it as acceptable, it would be egosyntonic.   flight of ideas. a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech with abrupt  changes from topic to topic, usually based on understandable associations, dis tracting stimuli, or plays on words. when severe, the speech may be disorga nized and incoherent.      flight of ideas is most frequently seen in manic episodes, but may also  be observed in some cases of organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, other  psychotic disorders, and, occasionally, acute reactions to stress.   formal thought disorder. a disturbance in the form of thought as  distinguished from the content of thought. the boundaries of the concept are  not clear and there is no consensus as to which disturbances in speech or  thought are included in the concept. for this reason, \"formal thought disorder\"  is not used as a specific descriptive term in dsm-iii. see loosening of associa tions, incoherence, poverty of content of speech, neologisms, perseveration,  blocking, echolalia, clanging.   grandiosity. an inflated appraisal of one\\'s worth, power, knowledge, im portance, or identity. when extreme, grandiosity may be of delusional pro portions. example: a professor who frequently puts his students to sleep with  his boring lectures is convinced that he is one of the more dynamic and exciting  teachers at the university.   hallucination. a sensory perception without external stimulation of the  relevant sensory organ. a hallucination has the immediate sense of reality of a  true perception, although in some instances the source of the hallucination may  be perceived as within the body (e.g., an auditory hallucination may be experi enced as coming from within the head rather than through the ears). (some  investigators limit the concept of true hallucinations to sensations whose source   360 appendix b  is perceived as being external to the body, but the clinical significance of this distinction has yet to be demonstrated, so it is not made in this manual.)     there may or may not be a delusional interpretation of the hallucinatory experience. for example, one person with auditory hallucinations may recognize that he or she is having a false sensory experience whereas another may be convinced that the source of the sensory experience has an independent physical reality. strictly speaking, hallucinations indicate a psychotic disturbance only when they are associated with gross impairment in reality testing (see psychotic). the term hallucination, by itself, is not ordinarily applied to the false perceptions that occur during dreaming, while falling asleep (hypnagogic), or when awakening (hypnopompic). hallucinations occurring in the course of an intensely shared religious experience generally have no pathological significance.     hallucinations should be distinguished from illusions, in which an external stimulus is misperceived or misinterpreted, and from normal thought processes that are exceptionally vivid. transient hallucinatory experiences are common in individuals without mental disorder.          hallucination, auditory. a hallucination of sound, most commonly of     voices, but sometimes of clicks, rushing noises, music, etc.          hallucination, gustatory. a hallucination of taste, unpleasant tastes     being the most common.          hallucination, mood-congruent. see mood-congruent psychotic fea    tures.          hallucination, mood-incongruent. see mood-incongruent psychotic fea    tures.          hallucination, olfactory. a hallucination involving smell. example: a     woman complained of a persistent smell of dead bodies. some individuals     are convinced they have a body odor they themselves cannot smell; this     symptom is a delusion, not an olfactory hallucination.          hallucination, somatic. a hallucination involving the perception of a     physical experience localized within the body. example: a feeling of elec    tricity running through one\\'s body.         somatic hallucinations are to be distinguished from unexplained physi    cal sensations; a somatic hallucination can be identified with certainty only     when a delusional interpretation of a physical illness is present. a somatic     hallucination is to be distinguished also from hypochondriacal preoccupa    tion with, or exaggeration of, normal physical sensations and from a tac    tile hallucination, in which the sensation is usually related to the skin.          hallucination, tactile. a hallucination involving the sense of touch,     often of something on or under the skin. almost invariably the symptom     is associated with a delusional interpretation of the sensation. examples:                                         glossary of technical terms 361      a man said he could feel the devil putting pins into his flesh; another     claimed he could feel himself being penetrated anally; still another com    plained of experiencing pains, which he attributed to the devil, throughout     his body, although there was no evidence of any physical illness.         a particular tactile hallucination is formication, which is the sensation     of something creeping or crawling on or under the skin. often there is a     delusional interpretation of the sensation, as when it is attributed to insects     or worms. formication is seen in alcohol withdrawal delirium and the     withdrawal phase of cocaine intoxication.         tactile hallucinations of pain are to be distinguished from psycho    genie pain disorder, in which there is no delusional interpretation.          hallucination, visual. a hallucination involving sight, which may con    sist of formed images, such as of people, or of unformed images, such as     flashes of light. visual hallucinations should be distinguished from illusions,     which are misperceptions of real external stimuli.  hypochondriasis. unrealistic interpretation of physical signs or sensations as abnormal, leading to preoccupation with the fear or belief of having a disease.  idea of reference. an idea, held less firmly than a delusion, that events, objects, or other people in the person\\'s immediate environment have a particular and unusual meaning specifically for him or her. see also delusion of reference.  identity. the sense of self, providing a unity of personality over time. prominent disturbances in identity or the sense of self are seen in schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and identity disorder.  illogical thinking. thinking that contains clear internal contradictions or in which conclusions are reached that are clearly erroneous, given the initial premises. it may be seen in individuals without mental disorder, particularly in situations in which they are distracted or fatigued. illogical thinking has psychopathological significance only when it is marked, as in the examples noted below, and when it is not due to cultural or religious values or to intellectual deficit. markedly illogical thinking may lead to, or result from, a delusional belief or may be observed in the absence of a delusion.     examples: a patient explained that she gave her family ibm cards, which  she punched, in an effort to improve communication with them. another patient  stated: \"parents are the people that raise you. ', 'parents can be anything—mate rial, vegetable, or mineral—that has taught you something. ', 'a person can look  at a rock and learn something from it, so a rock is a parent.', '\" in response to  the question \"why did you go to kingston?\" a patient replied, \"because i  believe in the king james bible and my name is james. ', 'i went to kingston to  see the queen.', '\"   illusion. a misperception of a real external stimulus. examples: the rustling  of leaves is heard as the sound of voices; a man claims that when he looks in  a mirror, he sees his face distorted and misshapen. see also hallucination.   362 appendix b  incoherence. speech that, for the most part, is not understandable, owing to any of the following: a lack of logical or meaningful connection between words, phrases, or sentences; excessive use of incomplete sentences; excessive irrelevancies or abrupt changes in subject matter; idiosyncratic word usage; distorted grammar. mildly ungrammatical constructions or idiomatic usages characteristic of particular regional or ethnic backgrounds, lack of education, or low intelligence should not be considered incoherence; and the term is generally not applied when there is evidence that the disturbance in speech is due to an aphasia.     example: interviewer: \"why do you think people believe in god?\" subject: \"um, because making a do in life. ', \"isn't none of that stuff about evolution guiding isn't true anymore now. \", 'it all happened a long time ago. ', \"it happened in eons and eons and stuff they wouldn't believe in him. \", \"the time that jesus christ people believe in their thing people believed in, jehovah god that they didn't believe in jesus christ that much.\", '\"     incoherence may be seen in some organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.  insomnia. difficulty falling or staying asleep. initial insomnia is difficulty in falling asleep. middle insomnia involves an awakening, followed by difficulty returning to sleep, but eventually doing so. terminal insomnia is awakening at least two hours before one\\'s usual waking time and being unable to return to sleep.  loosening of associations. thinking characterized by speech in which ideas shift from one subject to another that is completely unrelated or only obliquely related without the speaker\\'s showing any awareness that the topics are unconnected. statements that lack a meaningful relationship may be juxtaposed, or the individual may shift idiosyncratically from one frame of reference to another: when loosening of associations is severe, speech may be incoherent. the term is generally not applied when abrupt shifts in topics are associated  with a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech (as in flight of ideas).     example: interviewer: \"what did you think of the whole watergate affair?\" subject: \"you know i didn\\'t tune in on that, i felt so bad about it. ', \"i  said, boy, i'm not going to know what's going on in this. \", \"but it seemed to get so murky, and everybody's reports were so negative. \", \"huh, i thought, i  don't want any part of this, and i don't care who was in on it, and all i could figure out was artie had something to do with it. \", 'artie was trying to flush the bathroom toilet of the white house or something. ', 'she was trying to do something fairly simple. ', 'the tour guests stuck or something. ', 'she got blamed because the water overflowed, went down in the basement, down, to the kitchen. ', 'they had a, they were going to have to repaint and restore the white house room, the enormous living room. ', 'and then it was at this reunion they were having.  ', \"and it's just such a mess and i just thought, well, i'm just going to pretend like i don't even know what's going on. \", 'so i came downstairs and \\'cause i pretended like i didn\\'t know what was going on, i slipped on the floor of the                                         glossary of technical terms 363  kitchen, cracking my toe, when i was teaching some kids how to do some double dives.\"     loosening of associations may be seen in schizophrenia, manic episodes, and other psychotic disorders.  magical thinking. the individual believes that his or her thoughts, words, or actions might, or will in some manner cause or prevent a specific outcome in some way that defies the normal laws of cause and effect. example: a man believed that if he said a specific prayer three times each night, his mother\\'s death might be prevented indefinitely; a mother believed that if she had an angry thought her child would become ill.     magical thinking may be part of ideas of reference or may reach delusional proportions when the individual maintains a firm conviction about the belief despite evidence to the contrary.     magical thinking is seen in children, in people in primitive cultures, and in schizotypal personality disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder.  mental disorder. in dsm-iii, a mental disorder is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychologic syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that typically is associated with either a painful symptom (distress) or impairment in one or more important areas of functioning (disability). in addition, there is an inference that there is a behavioral, psychologic, or biologic dysfunction, and that the disturbance is not only in the relationship between the individual and society. when the disturbance is limited to a conflict between an individual and society, this may represent social deviance, which may or may not be commendable, but is not by itself a mental disorder.  mood. a pervasive and sustained emotion that in the extreme, markedly colors the person\\'s perception of the world. mood is to affect as climate is to weather. common examples of mood include depression, elation, anger, and anxiety.          mood, dysphoric. an unpleasant mood, such as depression, anxiety, or     irritability.          mood, elevated. a mood that is more cheerful than normal; it does not     necessarily imply pathology.          mood, euphoric. an exaggerated feeling of well-being. as a technical     term, euphoria implies a pathological mood. whereas the individual with a     normally elevated mood may describe himself or herself as being in \"good     spirits,\" \"very happy,\" or \"cheerful,\" the euphoric person is likely to     exclaim that he or she is \"on top of the world,\" \"up in the clouds,\" or to     say, \"i feel ecstatic,\" \"i\\'m flying,\" or \"i am high.\"          mood, euthymic. mood in the \"normal\" range, which implies the ab    sence of depressed or elevated mood.   364 appendix b          mood, expansive. lack of restraint in expressing one\\'s feelings, fre    quently with an overvaluation of one\\'s significance or importance. there     may also be elevated or euphoric mood.          mood, irritable. internalized feeling of tension associated with being     easily annoyed and provoked to anger.  mood-congruent psychotic features. delusions or hallucinations whose content is entirely consistent with either a depressed or a manic mood. if the mood is depressed, the content of the delusions or hallucinations would involve themes of either personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment. if the mood is manic, the content of the delusions or hallucinations would involve themes of inflated worth, power, knowledge, or identity, or special relationship to a deity or a famous person.  mood-incongruent psychotic features. delusions or hallucinations whose content is not consistent with either a depressed or a manic mood. in the case of depression, a delusion or hallucination whose content does not involve themes of either personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment. in the case of mania, a delusion or hallucination whose content does not involve themes of either inflated worth, power, knowledge, or identity or special relationship with a deity or a famous person. examples of such symptoms are persecutory delusions, thought insertion, thought broadcasting, and delusions of being controlled, whose content has no apparent relationship to any of the themes noted above. (note: the catatonic symptoms of stupor, mutism, negativism, and posturing in manic episodes are also considered mood-incongruent psychotic features.)  neologisms. new words invented by the subject, distortions of words, or standard words to which the subject has given new, highly idiosyncratic meaning. the judgment that neologisms are present should be made cautiously, taking into account the subject\\'s educational and cultural background. examples: \"i was accused of midigation\" (meaning the subject was accused of breaking the law). \"they had an insinuating machine next door\" (person explaining how her neighbors were bothering her).     neologisms may be observed in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  neurotic disorder. a mental disorder in which the predominant disturbance is a symptom or group of symptoms that is distressing to the individual and is recognized by him or her as unacceptable and alien (ego-dystonic); reality testing is grossly intact. behavior does not actively violate gross social norms (though it may be quite disabling). the disturbance is relatively enduring or recurrent without treatment, and is not limited to a transitory reaction to stressors. there is no demonstrable organic etiology or factor.  neurotic process. a specific etiological process involving the following                                         glossary of technical terms 365  sequence: (1) unconscious conflicts between opposing desires or between desires and prohibitions, which cause (2) unconscious perception of anticipated danger or dysphoria, which leads to (3) use of defense mechanisms that result in (4) either symptoms, personality disturbance, or both.  obsessions. recurrent, persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses that are ego-dystonic, that is, they are not experienced as voluntarily produced, but rather as ideas that invade consciousness.     obsessions are characteristic of obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be seen in schizophrenia.  orientation. awareness of where one is in relation to time, place, and person.  overvalued idea. an unreasonable and sustained belief or idea that is maintained with less than delusional intensity. it differs from an obsessional thought in that the person holding the overvalued idea does not recognize its absurdity and thus does not struggle against it. as with a delusion, the idea or belief is not one that is ordinarily accepted by other members of the person\\'s culture or subculture.     example: a patient with a long-standing hand-washing compulsion thought there might be danger in shaking hands with people, because they might have recently been inoculated against smallpox and be infectious. although she acknowledged that the danger might not be real, she could not accept reassurances that there was medically no danger.  panic attacks. discrete periods of sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness, or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. during the attacks there are such symptoms as dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain or discomfort, choking or smothering sensations, and fear of going crazy or losing control.     panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder, but may also occur in somatization disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.  paranoid ideation. ideation, of less than delusional proportions, involving suspiciousness or the belief that one is being harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated. in some instances the term is used when the clinician is unsure of whether the disturbances are actually delusional. ideas of reference often involve paranoid ideation.  perseveration. persistent repetition of words, ideas, or subjects so that, once an individual begins speaking about a particular subject or uses a particular word, it continually recurs. perseveration differs from the repetitive use of \"stock words\" or interjections such as \"you know\" or \"like.\"     examples: \"i think i\\'ll put on my hat, my hat, my hat, my hat.\" interviewer: \"tell me what you are like, what kind of person you are.\" subject:   366 appendix b  \"i\\'m from marshalltown, iowa. that\\'s 60 miles northwest, northeast of des moines, iowa. and i\\'m married at the present time. i\\'m 36 years old. my wife is 35. she lives in garwin, iowa. that\\'s 15 miles southeast of marshalltown, iowa. i\\'m getting a divorce at the present time. and i am at present in a mental institution in iowa city, iowa, which is 100 miles southeast of marshalltown, iowa.\"     perseveration is most commonly seen in organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.  personality. deeply ingrained patterns of behavior, which include the way one relates to, perceives, and thinks about the environment and oneself. personality traits are prominent aspects of personality, and do not imply pathology. personality disorder implies inflexible and maladaptive patterns of sufficient severity to cause either significant impairment in adaptive functioning or subjective distress.  phobia. a persistent, irrational fear of a specific object, activity, or situation that results in a compelling desire to avoid the dreaded object, activity, or situation (the phobic stimulus). more commonly, the individual does actually avoid the feared situation or object, though he or she recognizes that the fear is unreasonable and unwarranted by the actual dangerousness of the object, activity, or situation. some individuals with a phobia claim that their avoidance is rational because they anticipate overwhelming anxiety or some other strong emotion that is out of their control; they do not claim, however, that their anxiety is rationally justified.  poverty of content of speech. speech that is adequate in amount but conveys little information because of vagueness, empty repetitions, or use of stereotyped or obscure phrases. the interviewer may observe that the individual has spoken at some length but has not given adequate information to answer a question. alternatively, the individual may provide enough information to answer the question, but require many words to do so, so that his or her lengthy reply can be summarized in a sentence or two. the term poverty of content of speech is generally not used when the speech is, for the most part, not understandable (incoherence).     example: interviewer: \"ok. why is it, do you think, that people believe in god?\" patient: \"well, first of all because, he is the person that, is their personal savior. he walks with me and talks with me. and uh, the understanding that i have, a lot of peoples, they don\\'t really know their own personal self. because they ain\\'t, they all, just don\\'t know their own personal self. they don\\'t, know that he uh, seemed like to me, a lot of em don\\'t understand that he walks and talks with them. and uh, show \\'em their way to go. i understand also that, every man and every lady, is just not pointed in the same direction. some are pointed different. they go in their different ways. the way that jesus christ wanted \\'em to go. myself, i am pointed in the ways of uh, knowing right from wrong, and doing it. i can\\'t do any more, or not less, than that.\"                                         glossary of technical terms 367  poverty of speech. restriction in the amount of speech, so that spontaneous speech and replies to questions are brief and unelaborated. when the condition is marked, replies may be monosyllabic, and some questions may be unanswered.     poverty of speech occurs frequently in schizophrenia, major depressive episodes, and organic mental disorders, such as dementia.  pressure of speech. speech that is increased in amount, accelerated, and difficult or impossible to interrupt. usually it is also loud and emphatic. frequently, the individual talks without any social stimulation and may continue to talk even though no one is listening.     pressure of speech is most often seen in manic episodes, but may also occur in some cases of organic mental disorders, major depression with psychomotor agitation, schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and, occasionally, acute reactions to stress.  prodromal. early signs or symptoms of a disorder.  pseudodementia. clinical features resembling a dementia that are not due to organic brain dysfunction or disease. pseudodementia may occur in a major depressive episode or may be seen in factitious disorder with psychological symptoms.  psychomotor agitation. excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension; the activity is usually nonproductive and repetitious. when the agitation is severe, it may be accompanied by shouting or loud complaining. the term should be used in a technical sense to refer only to states of tension or restlessness that are accompanied by observable excessive motor activity. examples: inability to sit still, pacing, wringing of hands, pulling at clothes.  psychomotor retardation. visible generalized slowing down of physical reactions, movements, and speech.  psychotic. a term indicating gross impairment in reality testing. it may be used to describe the behavior of an individual at a given time, or a mental disorder in which at some time during its course all individuals with the disorder have grossly impaired reality testing. when there is gross impairment in reality  testing, the individual incorrectly evaluates the accuracy of his or her percep tions and thoughts and makes incorrect inferences about external reality, even in  the face of contrary evidence. the term psychotic does not apply to minor dis tortions of reality that involve matters of relative judgment. for example, a  depressed person who underestimated his achievements would not be described  as psychotic, whereas one who believed he had caused a natural catastrophe  would be so described.     direct evidence of psychotic behavior is the presence of either delusions or  hallucinations without insight into their pathological nature. the term psychotic  is sometimes appropriate when an individual\\'s behavior is so grossly disorga  368 appendix b  nized that a reasonable inference can be made that reality testing is disturbed. examples include markedly incoherent speech without apparent awareness by the person that the speech is not understandable, and the agitated, inattentive, and disoriented behavior seen in alcohol withdrawal delirium.     in dsm-ii the term psychotic was applied to individuals whose \"mental functioning [was] sufficiently impaired to interfere grossly with their capacity to meet the ordinary demands of life,\" whether or not there was impaired reality testing. this definition of psychotic did not conform to common usage, which generally limited use of the term to impairment in reality testing, as does the dsm-iii definition. as a result, the value of the term for communication was diminished, since it was then unclear whether or not an individual described as being psychotic had gross impairment in reality testing. it should also be noted that an individual with a nonpsychotic mental disorder may exhibit psychotic behavior, though rarely. for example, an individual with obsessive compulsive disorder may at times come to believe in the reality of the danger of being contaminated by shaking hands with strangers.     in dsm-iii the psychotic disorders include pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenic and paranoid disorders, psychotic disorders not elsewhere classified, some organic mental disorders, and some affective disorders.  residual. the phase of an illness that occurs after remission of the florid symptoms or the full syndrome. examples: the residual states of infantile autism, attention deficit disorder, and schizophrenia.  sign. an objective manifestation of a pathological condition. signs are observed by the examiner rather than reported by the individual.  symptom. a manifestation of a pathological condition. although in some uses of the term it is limited to subjective complaints, in common use \"symptom\" includes objective signs of pathological conditions as well.  syndrome. a grouping of symptoms that occur together and that constitute a recognizable condition. the term \"syndrome\" is less specific than \"disorder\" or \"disease.', '\" the term \"disease\" generally implies a specific etiology or pathophysiological process. ', 'in dsm-iii most of the disorders are, in fact, syndromes.

international classification of diseases (icd-9), and some of the major changes from icd-8. \", 'in addition, the clinical modification of icd-9 (icd-9-cm) that was introduced in the united states, and the relationship between it and the dsm-iii classification are discussed.                       ', 'purposes and uses of the icd      the icd is a statistical classification not only of mental disorders but of diseases and other morbid conditions; complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium; congenital abnormalities; causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality; accidents, poisonings, and violence; and symptoms, signs, and illdefined conditions. ', 'its principal use is in the classification of morbidity and mortality information for statistical purposes, as the unabridged title of the classification makes quite clear: the international statistical classification of diseases, injuries, and causes of death.     ', 'the icd has also been adapted for use as a nomenclature of diseases for indexing medical records. ', 'the basic purpose of such indexing is to facilitate retrieval of medical records for a variety of purposes (for example, studies of management of patients with specific conditions; follow-up studies of patients with specific diseases who have undergone various operative and therapeutic procedures). ', 'its limitations for these purposes led to the development of the icd-9-cm in the united states-—a subject to be discussed below.     ', 'it is essential to keep in mind that the icd is a statistical classification of diseases, not a nomenclature of diseases. ', 'the distinction between these two is important. ', 'a nomenclature of diseases is a list or catalogue of approved terms for describing and recording clinical and pathological observations. ', 'to serve its full function it must be sufficiently extensive so that any pathological condition can be accurately recorded. ', 'as medical science advances, a nomenclature must expand to include the new terms necessary to record new observations.

', 'organizational arrangement of icd-9      the icd is organized into 17 major sections, each of which is devoted to a  specific set of conditions (table 1). ', 'each of these major sections is subdivided into a defined set of categories, each identified by three digits ranging from 001 to 999. ', 'to provide greater detail, each such category is further divided into additional subcategories by a fourth digit (.0 to .9). ', 'table 1 shows the number of three-digit categories allotted to each major section. ', 'only 30 are allotted to  mental disorders, so that all mental disorders must be classified within these  30 categories and their fourth-digit subdivisions.     ', 'the structure of the classification is such that the axes of classification are  not consistent within each of the 17 major sections. ', 'in some of these categories  (e.g., diseases of the respiratory system) the primary axis is topographical; less frequently it is etiological (e.g., infectious diseases) or situational (e.g., complica tions of pregnancy). ', 'in other sections, still other primary axes are used, re flecting the fact that the icd provides a pragmatic classification that can be used for a variety of purposes.     ', 'there are also two supplementary chapters: one for classification of external causes of injury and poisoning (the e codes), and the other for classification of factors influencing health status and contact with health services (the  v codes). ', 'both of these classifications contain items of relevance to agencies  and facilities that provide mental health services.                           ', 'revisions of the icd      the icd is revised regularly, at approximately ten-year intervals. ', 'this pattern was initiated with the first revision conference of the international list  of causes of death, held in paris in 1900. ', 'the original classification, as indicated  by its title, was used solely for coding causes of death, and did not provide a  separate section for the mental disorders until the fifth revision of that list  (1938). ', 'in that revision, mental disorders were assigned only a single three digit rubric with four subcategories within the section on diseases of the nervous system and sense organs: ', '(a) mental deficiency; ', '(b) schizophrenia;  ', '(c) manic depressive psychosis; and ', '(d) all other mental disorders. ', 'the con ference for the sixth revision (1948) expanded the classification for use not  only for causes of death but also for causes of morbidity. ', 'icd-6 contained the  first separate section on mental disorders (section v). ', 'no major revisions were  made in that section in icd-7 (1955).     ', 'the international community of psychiatrists expressed considerable dis satisfaction with the classification of mental disorders in icd-6 and icd-7;  consequently, it was not widely used (stengel, 1959).

', \"in addition to     helping to minimize the discrepancies among the diagnostic concepts used     by psychiatrists in different countries for the statistical reporting of mental     illness, use of the glossary in publications dealing with either clinical work     or research will also assist psychiatrists from different countries and schools     of thought in understanding each other's work and concepts.                        \", 'the ninth revision of icd      to develop revision proposals for icd-9, who initiated an intensive program to obtain information on problems encountered by psychiatrists in different countries in the use of the mental disorders section of icd-8 and to formulate recommendations for their solutions (shepherd, et al, 1968).

', 'as stated by who (1978):         changes and new categories in the international classification of dis    eases (icd-9) have been introduced only for sound reasons and after     much consideration.

', 'this difference is     considered to be justified because of the special problems posed for     psychiatrists by the relative lack of independent laboratory information     upon which to base their diagnoses. ', 'the diagnosis of many of the most     important mental disorders still relies largely upon descriptions of abnormal     experience and behaviour, and without some guidance in the form of a     glossary that can serve as a common frame of reference, psychiatric com    munications easily became unsatisfactory at both clinical and statistical     levels.         ', 'many well-known terms have different meanings in current use, and     it is important for the user to use the glossary descriptions and not merely     the category titles when searching for the best fit for the condition he is     trying to code.

', '\"combination categories\" such as these have been eliminated from icd-9 and replaced by categories that require coding on two independent axes.

', 'multiaxial classification       the concept of a multiaxial classification system for mental disorders was  first proposed at the who seminar on the mental disorders of childhood, in  paris in 1967 (rutter et al, 1969). ', 'the condition of the child was to be re corded on three axes: clinical syndrome, intellectual level, and etiologic factors.  ', 'two years later, during the seminar in washington on the problems of classi fication of mental retardation, another axis was suggested for coding associated  social and cultural factors (tarjan et al., 1972).      ', 'who has initiated a number of international studies to obtain empirical  data about the usefulness of the multiaxial classification. ', 'in one of these, carried  out in the united kingdom and involving a large number of child psychiatrists,  a series of patients were assessed using both the triaxial approach and the  icd. ', 'case histories were also used to assess the agreement between psychia trists using these two classificatory systems. ', 'the results of this study clearly  demonstrated that a multiaxial classification system can be used, and that it  provides more and better data about the patients seen and assessed (rutter  et al., 1975).

', 'however, in the united states, clinicians and  others responsible for the care of patients found they needed a classification  with more specificity than that provided by icd-9. ', 'accordingly, the national  center for health statistics convened during 1977 a steering committee to advise  the council on clinical classifications on how to modify icd-9 to satisfy this  need. ', 'this council was sponsored by the following organizations: american  academy of pediatrics, american college of obstetricians and gynecologists,  american college of physicians, american college of surgeons, american  psychiatric association, and commission on professional and hospital activities.  ', \"the task forces on classification of these organizations provided clinical guidance  and technical input to the development of icd-9-cm, the clinical modification  of the world health organization's international classification of diseases,  9th revision. \", \"as stated in the introduction to icd-9-cm (1978):          the term 'clinical' is used to emphasize the modification's intent: to      serve as a useful tool in the area of classification of morbidity data for in     dexing of medical records, medical care review, and ambulatory and other      medical care programs, as well as for basic health statistics. \", 'to describe the      clinical picture of the patient, the codes must be more precise than those      needed only for statistical groupings and trends analysis.       ', 'icd-9-cm is compatible with its parent system, icd-9, thus meeting the  need for comparability of morbidity and mortality statistics at the international  level. ', 'this was accomplished by: ', '(a) keeping the contents and the sequence of  the three-digit rubrics of icd-9 unchanged; ', '(b) not adding new three-digit  rubrics to the main body of the classification; ', '(c) adding a fifth digit to the exist ing icd-9 rubrics; and ', '(d) creating a few four-digit codes in existing three-digit  rubrics only when the necessary detail could not be accommodated by the use of  a fifth-digit subclassification.      ', \"as of the time when who had essentially completed its work on icd-9,  the american psychiatric association's task force on nomenclature and sta tistics was still in the midst of preparing the third edition of its diagnostic and  statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-iii). \", 'as a result, it was not pos sible to have revised diagnostic terms submitted in time for inclusion in icd-9.  ', 'however, the chair of this apa task force was invited by the council on  clinical classifications to submit for inclusion in icd-9-cm, those dsm-iii  terms not included in icd-9. ', 'after icd-9-cm went into effect on 1 january  1979, further changes were made in the still evolving dsm-iii classification.  ', 'all of the terms in the final dsm-iii classification are either included in the  icd-9-cm volume itself or published as addenda to the icd-9-cm in issues of   408 appendix d  medical record news as recommended terms or inclusion terms (acceptable as alternative terms).', '*     the classification of affective psychoses in icd-9-cm (code 296) departs considerably from that in icd-9. ', 'it is important for the users of this category to be aware of the fact that, in some instances, the same four-digit code numbers refer to different conditions in icd-9 and icd-9-cm. ', 'for example, the code 296.2 in icd-9 is \"manic depressive psychoses, circular type but currently manic,\" whereas in icd-9-cm, the same code is used for \"major depressive disorder, single episode.\"     it should also be noted that following the practice of icd-9, \"combination codes\" are not included in icd-9-cm. ', 'therefore, it is important for clinicians and others using icd-9-cm to become acquainted with codes for other diseases and other conditions that are to be entered on axis iii of the dsm-iii classification (for physical disorders and conditions).                               ', 'summary      the international classification of diseases (icd) is an essential tool for the collection and dissemination of comparable mortality and morbidity data throughout the world. ', 'mental disorders have been assigned an increasingly prominent place in the icd; and the proposals for their classification in the 9th revision, which became effective as of i january 1979, have been formulated on the basis of an extensive who program involving a series of seminars and consultations with leading mental health experts in many countries.

', 'all who  agreed to complete the required work were accepted as participants, either as private practitioners or as groups of clinicians working within facilities. ', 'the  clinicians were from all parts of the country, from maine to hawaii, and worked in both rural and urban settings. ', 'over 75% identified their main professional activity as evaluation or care of patients. ', 'the rest were engaged in administra tion (6%), teaching (7%), or research (6%).     ', 'only clinicians who joined in groups participated in the reliability study. ', 'each of these clinicians was asked to participate in at least four reliability evaluations with another clinician. ', '(most of the clinicians evaluated four patients each; some evaluated only one, and a few evaluated many.) these four assessments were to be done after each clinician had already had experience using the dsmiii draft to evaluate at least 15 patients selected from their patient population either as consecutive admissions or on a catch-as-catch-can basis (an approxima tion of the ideal of random sampling). ', 'each individual was evaluated on each of  the five axes. ', 'the reliability interviews, with only a few exceptions, were initial diagnostic evaluations before treatment was initiated.

', 'for  example, they were cautioned not to choose cases specifically because they pre sented no differential diagnostic problems or to discuss a case before each clini cian had independently filled out the diagnostic forms. ', 'the participants were re minded that dsm-iii was on trial—not they—and that they should not hesitate  to send in their results, even if there was poor agreement.      ', 'the two clinicians evaluating the same individual were to have access to  the same material, such as case records, letters of referral, nursing notes, and  family informants. ', 'if one clinician had such information (e.g., spoke to a family  member), he or she was to inform the other clinician of the additional informa tion, but avoid communicating his or her diagnostic impression. ', 'the two clini cians could either be present at the same evaluation interview or arrange to do  separate evaluations as close together in time as possible. ', 'in phase one, approxi mately 60% of adult as well as child and adolescent diagnostic assessments were  done in separate evaluations, and in phase two about two-thirds of all evalua tions were done separately. ', 'approximately 300 clinicians evaluated a total of  670 adult patients (18 years and older). ', 'approximately 84 clinicians evaluated a  total of 126 child and adolescent patients, approximately half of whom were  below the age of eleven.   ', 'results   the interrater reliability from phase one and phase two, for the diagnostic  classes and subclasses that were represented in the patient sample, is presented  in table 1 (adults) and table 2 (children and adolescents). ', 'reliability is expressed  using the kappa statistic, which indexes chance-corrected agreement (1). ', 'a high  kappa (generally 0.7 and above) indicates good agreement as to whether or not  the patient has a disorder within that diagnostic class, even if there is dis agreement about the specific disorder within the class. ', 'for example, diagnoses of  schizophrenia, paranoid type and schizophrenia, catatonic type by two clini cians would be considered agreement on schizophrenia. ', 'similarly, if one clinician  diagnoses borderline personality disorder and the other schizotypal personality  disorder, this is considered agreement on whether or not there is a personality  disorder. ', 'the overall kappa for the major classes of axis i indicates the extent  to which there is agreement across all diagnostic classes for all patients given an  axis i diagnosis by at least one of the clinicians, and is thus an overall index of  diagnostic agreement.      ', 'for adult patients, the reliability for most of the classes in both phases is  quite good, and in general higher than that previously achieved with dsm-i and  dsm-ii (2). ', 'it is particularly encouraging that the reliability for such important  categories as schizophrenia and major affective disorders is so high.      ', 'it is also noteworthy that the reliability in general improved in phase two,  perhaps due to the refinements in the criteria used in phase two. ', 'although  personality disorder as a class is evaluated more reliably than previously, with  the exception of antisocial personality disorder (kappa 0.87 and 0.65 in phase  one and phase two respectively), the kappas for the specific personality dis orders are quite low and range from 0.26 to 0.75.                                               ', 'dsm-iii field trials 469      the overall reliability of the diagnostic classes for children and adolescents (table 2) in phase one was the same as that for adults. ', 'however, the reliabilities in phase two tended to be lower than in phase one, for reasons that are not clear. ', 'this was particularly the case for adjustment disorder, a diagnostic category given to nearly a third of the cases. ', 'although the reliability obtained using the dsm-iii classification with children and adolescents is only fair, it is still far higher than that obtained using the classification developed for use with children by a committee of the group for the advancement of psychiatry (3).     ', 'table 3 presents the intraclass reliability coefficients for axes iv and v for children and adolescents and for adults. ', 'the reliability of the assessment of the severity of psychosocial stressors is at least fair. ', 'the reliability of the assessment of the highest level of adaptive functioning past year is generally quite good.

(note: the catatonic symptoms of stupor, mutism, negativism, and posturing in manic episodes are also considered mood-incongruent psychotic features.)  neologisms. new words invented by the subject, distortions of words, or standard words to which the subject has given new, highly idiosyncratic meaning. the judgment that neologisms are present should be made cautiously, taking into account the subject\\'s educational and cultural background. examples: \"i was accused of midigation\" (meaning the subject was accused of breaking the law). \"they had an insinuating machine next door\" (person explaining how her neighbors were bothering her).     neologisms may be observed in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  neurotic disorder. a mental disorder in which the predominant disturbance is a symptom or group of symptoms that is distressing to the individual and is recognized by him or her as unacceptable and alien (ego-dystonic); reality testing is grossly intact. behavior does not actively violate gross social norms (though it may be quite disabling). the disturbance is relatively enduring or recurrent without treatment, and is not limited to a transitory reaction to stressors. there is no demonstrable organic etiology or factor.  neurotic process. a specific etiological process involving the following                                         glossary of technical terms 365  sequence: (1) unconscious conflicts between opposing desires or between desires and prohibitions, which cause (2) unconscious perception of anticipated danger or dysphoria, which leads to (3) use of defense mechanisms that result in (4) either symptoms, personality disturbance, or both.  obsessions. recurrent, persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses that are ego-dystonic, that is, they are not experienced as voluntarily produced, but rather as ideas that invade consciousness.     obsessions are characteristic of obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be seen in schizophrenia.  orientation. awareness of where one is in relation to time, place, and person.  overvalued idea. an unreasonable and sustained belief or idea that is maintained with less than delusional intensity. it differs from an obsessional thought in that the person holding the overvalued idea does not recognize its absurdity and thus does not struggle against it. as with a delusion, the idea or belief is not one that is ordinarily accepted by other members of the person\\'s culture or subculture.     example: a patient with a long-standing hand-washing compulsion thought there might be danger in shaking hands with people, because they might have recently been inoculated against smallpox and be infectious. although she acknowledged that the danger might not be real, she could not accept reassurances that there was medically no danger.  panic attacks. discrete periods of sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness, or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. during the attacks there are such symptoms as dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain or discomfort, choking or smothering sensations, and fear of going crazy or losing control.     panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder, but may also occur in somatization disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.  paranoid ideation. ideation, of less than delusional proportions, involving suspiciousness or the belief that one is being harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated. in some instances the term is used when the clinician is unsure of whether the disturbances are actually delusional. ideas of reference often involve paranoid ideation.  perseveration. persistent repetition of words, ideas, or subjects so that, once an individual begins speaking about a particular subject or uses a particular word, it continually recurs. perseveration differs from the repetitive use of \"stock words\" or interjections such as \"you know\" or \"like.\"     examples: \"i think i\\'ll put on my hat, my hat, my hat, my hat.\" interviewer: \"tell me what you are like, what kind of person you are.\" subject:   366 appendix b  \"i\\'m from marshalltown, iowa. that\\'s 60 miles northwest, northeast of des moines, iowa. and i\\'m married at the present time. i\\'m 36 years old. my wife is 35. she lives in garwin, iowa. that\\'s 15 miles southeast of marshalltown, iowa. i\\'m getting a divorce at the present time. and i am at present in a mental institution in iowa city, iowa, which is 100 miles southeast of marshalltown, iowa.\"     perseveration is most commonly seen in organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.  personality. deeply ingrained patterns of behavior, which include the way one relates to, perceives, and thinks about the environment and oneself. personality traits are prominent aspects of personality, and do not imply pathology. personality disorder implies inflexible and maladaptive patterns of sufficient severity to cause either significant impairment in adaptive functioning or subjective distress.  phobia. a persistent, irrational fear of a specific object, activity, or situation that results in a compelling desire to avoid the dreaded object, activity, or situation (the phobic stimulus). more commonly, the individual does actually avoid the feared situation or object, though he or she recognizes that the fear is unreasonable and unwarranted by the actual dangerousness of the object, activity, or situation. some individuals with a phobia claim that their avoidance is rational because they anticipate overwhelming anxiety or some other strong emotion that is out of their control; they do not claim, however, that their anxiety is rationally justified.  poverty of content of speech. speech that is adequate in amount but conveys little information because of vagueness, empty repetitions, or use of stereotyped or obscure phrases. the interviewer may observe that the individual has spoken at some length but has not given adequate information to answer a question. alternatively, the individual may provide enough information to answer the question, but require many words to do so, so that his or her lengthy reply can be summarized in a sentence or two. the term poverty of content of speech is generally not used when the speech is, for the most part, not understandable (incoherence).     example: interviewer: \"ok. why is it, do you think, that people believe in god?\" patient: \"well, first of all because, he is the person that, is their personal savior. he walks with me and talks with me. and uh, the understanding that i have, a lot of peoples, they don\\'t really know their own personal self. because they ain\\'t, they all, just don\\'t know their own personal self. they don\\'t, know that he uh, seemed like to me, a lot of em don\\'t understand that he walks and talks with them. and uh, show \\'em their way to go. i understand also that, every man and every lady, is just not pointed in the same direction. some are pointed different. they go in their different ways. the way that jesus christ wanted \\'em to go. myself, i am pointed in the ways of uh, knowing right from wrong, and doing it. i can\\'t do any more, or not less, than that.\"                                         glossary of technical terms 367  poverty of speech. restriction in the amount of speech, so that spontaneous speech and replies to questions are brief and unelaborated. when the condition is marked, replies may be monosyllabic, and some questions may be unanswered.     poverty of speech occurs frequently in schizophrenia, major depressive episodes, and organic mental disorders, such as dementia.  pressure of speech. speech that is increased in amount, accelerated, and difficult or impossible to interrupt. usually it is also loud and emphatic. frequently, the individual talks without any social stimulation and may continue to talk even though no one is listening.     pressure of speech is most often seen in manic episodes, but may also occur in some cases of organic mental disorders, major depression with psychomotor agitation, schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and, occasionally, acute reactions to stress.  prodromal. early signs or symptoms of a disorder.  pseudodementia. clinical features resembling a dementia that are not due to organic brain dysfunction or disease. pseudodementia may occur in a major depressive episode or may be seen in factitious disorder with psychological symptoms.  psychomotor agitation. excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension; the activity is usually nonproductive and repetitious. when the agitation is severe, it may be accompanied by shouting or loud complaining. the term should be used in a technical sense to refer only to states of tension or restlessness that are accompanied by observable excessive motor activity. examples: inability to sit still, pacing, wringing of hands, pulling at clothes.  psychomotor retardation. visible generalized slowing down of physical reactions, movements, and speech.  psychotic. a term indicating gross impairment in reality testing. it may be used to describe the behavior of an individual at a given time, or a mental disorder in which at some time during its course all individuals with the disorder have grossly impaired reality testing. when there is gross impairment in reality  testing, the individual incorrectly evaluates the accuracy of his or her percep tions and thoughts and makes incorrect inferences about external reality, even in  the face of contrary evidence. the term psychotic does not apply to minor dis tortions of reality that involve matters of relative judgment. for example, a  depressed person who underestimated his achievements would not be described  as psychotic, whereas one who believed he had caused a natural catastrophe  would be so described.     direct evidence of psychotic behavior is the presence of either delusions or  hallucinations without insight into their pathological nature. the term psychotic  is sometimes appropriate when an individual\\'s behavior is so grossly disorga  368 appendix b  nized that a reasonable inference can be made that reality testing is disturbed. examples include markedly incoherent speech without apparent awareness by the person that the speech is not understandable, and the agitated, inattentive, and disoriented behavior seen in alcohol withdrawal delirium.     in dsm-ii the term psychotic was applied to individuals whose \"mental functioning [was] sufficiently impaired to interfere grossly with their capacity to meet the ordinary demands of life,\" whether or not there was impaired reality testing. this definition of psychotic did not conform to common usage, which generally limited use of the term to impairment in reality testing, as does the dsm-iii definition. as a result, the value of the term for communication was diminished, since it was then unclear whether or not an individual described as being psychotic had gross impairment in reality testing. it should also be noted that an individual with a nonpsychotic mental disorder may exhibit psychotic behavior, though rarely. for example, an individual with obsessive compulsive disorder may at times come to believe in the reality of the danger of being contaminated by shaking hands with strangers.     in dsm-iii the psychotic disorders include pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenic and paranoid disorders, psychotic disorders not elsewhere classified, some organic mental disorders, and some affective disorders.  residual. the phase of an illness that occurs after remission of the florid symptoms or the full syndrome. examples: the residual states of infantile autism, attention deficit disorder, and schizophrenia.  sign. an objective manifestation of a pathological condition. signs are observed by the examiner rather than reported by the individual.  symptom. a manifestation of a pathological condition. although in some uses of the term it is limited to subjective complaints, in common use \"symptom\" includes objective signs of pathological conditions as well.  syndrome. a grouping of symptoms that occur together and that constitute a recognizable condition. the term \"syndrome\" is less specific than \"disorder\" or \"disease.',\n",
