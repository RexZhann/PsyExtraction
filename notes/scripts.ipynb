       "  'this block comprises a range of mental disorders grouped together on the basis of their common, demonstrable etiology in cerebral disease, brain injury, or other insult leading to cerebral dysfunction. the dysfunction may be primary, as in diseases, injuries, and insults that affect the brain directly or with predilec- tion; or secondary, as in systemic diseases and disorders that attack the brain only as one of the multiple organs or systems of the body involved. alcohol- and drug-caused brain disorders, though logically belonging to this group, are classified under f10-f19 because of practical advantages in keeping all disorders due to psychoactive substance use in a single block.',\n",
       "  'although the spectrum of psychopathological manifestations of the conditions included here is broad, the essential features of the disorders form two main clusters. on the one hand, there are syndromes in which the invariable and most prominent features are either disturbances of cognitive functions, such as memory, intellect, and learning, or disturbances of the sensorium, such as disorders of consciousness and attention. on the other hand, there are syndromes of which the most conspicuous manifestations are in the areas of perception (hallucinations), thought contents (delusions), or mood and emotion (depression, elation, anxiety), or in the overall pattern of personality and behaviour, while cognitive or sensory dysfunction is minimal or difficult to ascerta in. the latter group of disorders has less secure footing in this block than the former because it contains many disorders that are symptomatically similar to conditions classified in other blocks (f20 - f29, f30 - f39, f40 - f49, f60 - f69) and are known to occur without gross cerebral pathological change or dysfunction. however, the growing evidence that a variety of cerebral and systemic diseases are causally related to the occurrence of such syndromes pro- vides sufficient justification for their inclusion here in a clinically oriented classification.',\n",
       "  'the majority of the disorders in this block can, at least theoretically, have their onset at any age, except perhaps early childhood. in practice, most tend to start in adult life or old age. while some of these disorders are seemingly irreversible and progressive, others are transient or respond to currently available treatments.',\n",
       "  'use of the term \"organic\" does not imply that conditions elsewhere in this classification are \"nonorganic\" in the sense of having no cerebral substrate. in the present context, the term \"organic\" means simply that the syndrome so classified can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or',\n",

       "  'it follows from the foregoing that, in the majority of cases, the recording of a diagnosis of any one of the disorders in this block will require the use of two codes: one for the psychopathological syndrome and another for the underlying disorder. the etiological code should be selected from the relevant chapter of the overall icd-10 classification.',\n",
       "  'dementia',\n",
       "  'a general description of dementia is given here, to indicate the minimum requirement for the diagnosis of dementia of any type, and is followed by the criteria that govern the diagnosis of more specific types.',\n",
       "  \"dementia is a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, in which there is disturbance of multiple higher cortical functions, including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, cal- culation, learning capacity, language, and judgement. consciousness is not clouded. impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation. this syndrome occurs in alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular disease, and in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain.\",\n",
       "  'in assessing the presence or absence of a dementia, special care should be taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional factors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and general physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may account for failure to perform.',\n",
       "  'dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning, and usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, such as washing, dress- ing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and toilet activities. how such a decline manifests itself will depend largely on the social and cultural setting in which the patient lives. changes in role performance, such as lowered ability to keep or find a job, should not be used as criteria of dementia because of the large cross-cultural differences that exist in what is appropriate, and because there may be frequent, externally imposed changes in the availability of work within a particular culture.',\n",

       "  'diagnostic guidelines the primary requirement for diagnosis is evidence of a decline in both memory and thinking which is sufficient to impair personal activities of daily living, as described above. the impairment of memory typically affects the registra- tion, storage, and retrieval of new information, but previously learned and familiar material may also be lost, particularly in the later stages. dementia is more than dysmnesia: there is also impairment of thinking and of reasoning capacity, and a reduction in the flow of ideas. the processing of incoming information is impaired, in that the individual finds it increasingly difficult to attend to more than one stimulus at a time, such as taking part in a conver- sation with several persons, and to shift the focus of attention from one topic to another. if dementia is the sole diagnosis, evidence of clear consciousness is required. however, a double diagnosis of delirium superimposed upon dementia is common (f05.1). the above symptoms and impairments should have been evident for at least 6 months for a confident clinical diagnosis of dementia to be made.',\n",

',\n",
       "  'the dysfunction may be primary, as in diseases, injuries, and insults that affect the brain directly or with predilection; or secondary, as in systemic diseases and disorders that attack the brain only as one of the multiple organs or systems of the body involved. ',\n",

       "  'although the spectrum of psychopathological manifestations of the conditions included here is broad, the essential features of the disorders form two main clusters. ',\n",
       "  'on the one hand, there are syndromes in which the invariable and most prominent features are either disturbances of cognitive functions, such as memory, intellect, and learning, or disturbances of the sensorium, such as disorders of consciousness and attention. ',\n",
       "  'on the other hand, there are syndromes of which the most conspicuous manifestations are in the areas of perception (hallucinations), thought contents (delusions), or mood and emotion (depression, elation, anxiety), or in the overall pattern of personality and behaviour, while cognitive or sensory dysfunction is minimal or difficult to ascerta in. ',\n",
       "  'the latter group of disorders has less secure footing in this block than the former because it contains many disorders that are symptomatically similar to conditions classified in other blocks (f20 f29, f30 f39, f40 f49, f60 f69) and are known to occur without gross cerebral pathological change or dysfunction. ',\n",
       "  'however, the growing evidence that a variety of cerebral and systemic diseases are causally related to the occurrence of such syndromes provides sufficient justification for their inclusion here in a clinically oriented classification.  ',\n",
       "  'the majority of the disorders in this block can, at least theoretically, have their onset at any age, except perhaps early childhood. ',\n",
       "  'in practice, most tend to start in adult life or old age. ',\n",
       "  'while some of these disorders are seemingly irreversible and progressive, others are transient or respond to currently available treatments.  ',\n",
       "  'use of the term \"organic\" does not imply that conditions elsewhere in this classification are \"nonorganic\" in the sense of having no cerebral substrate. ',\n",
       "  'in the present context, the term \"organic\" means simply that the syndrome so classified can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or  44                                   f00-f09 organic mental disorders  systemic disease or disorder. ',\n",
       "  'the term \"symptomatic\" is used for those organic mental disorders in which cerebral involvement is secondary to a systemic extracerebral disease or disorder.  ',\n",
       "  'it follows from the foregoing that, in the majority of cases, the recording of a diagnosis of any one of the disorders in this block will require the use of two codes: one for the psychopathological syndrome and another for the underlying disorder. ',\n",
       "  'the etiological code should be selected from the relevant chapter of the overall icd-10 classification.  ',\n",
       "  'dementia  a general description of dementia is given here, to indicate the minimum requirement for the diagnosis of dementia of any type, and is followed by the criteria that govern the diagnosis of more specific types.  ',\n",
       "  'dementia is a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, in which there is disturbance of multiple higher cortical functions, including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgement. ',\n",
       "  'consciousness is not clouded. ',\n",
       "  'impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation. ',\n",
       "  \"this syndrome occurs in alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular disease, and in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain.  \",\n",
       "  'in assessing the presence or absence of a dementia, special care should be taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional factors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and general physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may account for failure to perform.  ',\n",
       "  'dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning, and usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, such as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and toilet activities. ',\n",
       "  'how such a decline manifests itself will depend largely on the social and cultural setting in which the patient lives. ',\n",
       "  'changes in role performance, such as lowered ability to keep or find a job, should not be used as criteria of dementia because of the large cross-cultural differences that exist in what is appropriate, and because there may be frequent, externally imposed changes in the availability of work within a particular culture.

       "  'the impairment of memory typically affects the registration, storage, and retrieval of new information, but previously learned and familiar material may also be lost, particularly in the later stages. ',\n",
       "  'dementia is more than dysmnesia: there is also impairment of thinking and of reasoning capacity, and a reduction in the flow of ideas. ',\n",
       "  'the processing of incoming information is impaired, in that the individual finds it increasingly difficult to attend to more than one stimulus at a time, such as taking part in a conversation with several persons, and to shift the focus of attention from one topic to another. ',\n",

',\n",
       "  'the development of this manual over the last five years has not gone unnoticed; in fact, it is remarkable how much interest (alarm, despair, excitement, joy) has been shown in successive drafts of this document. ',\n",
       "  'the reasons for this interest are many.     ',\n",
       "  'first of all, over the last decade there has been growing recognition of the importance of diagnosis for both clinical practice and research. ',\n",
       "  'clinicians and research investigators must have a common language with which to communicate about the disorders for which they have professional responsibility. ',\n",
       "  'planning a treatment program must begin with an accurate diagnostic assessment. ',\n",
       "  'the efficacy of various treatment modalities can be compared only if patient groups are described using diagnostic terms that are clearly defined.     ',\n",
       "  'secondly, from its very beginning, drafts of dsm-iii have been widely circulated for critical review and use by clinicians and investigators. ',\n",
       "  'this made them aware of the many fundamental ways in which dsm-iii differs from its predecessor, dsm-ii, and from its international contemporary, the mental disorders chapter of the ninth revision of the international classification of diseases (icd-9). ',\n",
       "  'for example, dsm-iii includes such new features as diagnostic criteria, a multiaxial approach to evaluation, much-expanded descriptions of the disorders and many additional categories (some with newly-coined names); and it does not include several time-honored categories.     ',\n",
       "  'finally, interest in the development of this manual is due to awareness that dsm-iii reflects an increased commitment in our field to reliance on data as the basis for understanding mental disorders.  ',\n",
       "  \"background* the first edition of the american psychiatric association's diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders appeared in 1952. \",\n",
       "  'this was the first official manual of mental disorders to contain a glossary of descriptions of the diagnostic categories. ',\n",
       "  'the use of the term \"reaction\" throughout the classification reflected the influence of adolf meyer\\'s psychobiological view that mental disorders represented reactions of the personality to psychological, social, and biological factors. ',\n",
       "  'in the development of the second edition (dsm-ii), a decision was made to base the classification on the mental disorders section of the eighth revision of the international classification of diseases, for which representatives of the american psychiatric association had provided consultation. ',\n",
       "  'both dsm-ii and  * some readers may wish, for now, to skip background and the process of development of dsm-iii and plunge directly into basic concepts on p.5.                                 ',\n",
       "  '1   2 introduction  icd-8 went into effect in 1968. ',\n",
       "  'the dsm-ii classification did not use the term \"reaction\" and used diagnostic terms that by and large did not imply a particular theoretical framework for understanding the nonorganic mental disorders.     ',\n",
       "  'in 1974 the american psychiatric association, through its council on research and development, appointed a task force on nomenclature and statistics to begin work on the development of dsm-iii, recognizing that icd-9 was scheduled to go into effect in january 1979. ',\n",
       "  'by the time this new task force was constituted, the mental disorders section of icd-9, which included its own glossary, was nearly completed. ',\n",
       "  'although representatives of the american psychiatric association had worked closely with the world health organization in the development of icd-9, there was some concern that the icd-9 classification and glossary would not be suitable for use in the united states. ',\n",
       "  'most importantly, many specific areas of the classification did not seem sufficiently detailed for clinical and research use. ',\n",
       "  'for example, the icd-9 classification contains only one category for \"frigidity and impotence\"—despite the substantial work in the area of psychosexual dysfunctions that has identified several specific types with different clinical pictures and treatment implications. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, the glossary of icd-9 was believed by many to be less than optimal in that it had not made use of such recent major methodological developments as specified diagnostic criteria and the multiaxial approach to evaluation.     ',\n",
       "  'for these reasons the task force was directed to prepare a new classification and glossary that would, as much as possible, reflect the most current state of knowledge regarding mental disorders while maintaining compatibility with icd-9. ',\n",
       "  'like its predecessors, dsm-i and dsm-ii, dsm-iii had to be, first of all, clinically useful, while also providing a basis for research and administrative use.      ',\n",
       "  'the task force. ',\n",
       "  'task force members, and consultants from the fields of psychology and epidemiology, were selected because of their special interest in various aspects of diagnosis. ',\n",

       "  'as the work progressed, additional members were added to ensure representation of different perspectives and areas of expertise.     ',\n",
       "  'from the beginning, the task force functioned as a steering committee to oversee the ongoing work. ',\n",
       "  'all of its members shared a commitment to the attainment in dsm-iii of the following goals:   —clinical usefulness for making treatment and management decisions in varied     clinical settings;   —reliability of the diagnostic categories;   —acceptability to clinicians and researchers of varying theoretical orientations;   —usefulness for educating health professionals;   —maintaining compatibility with icd-9, except when departures are unavoid    able;   —avoiding the introduction of new terminology and concepts that break with     tradition, except when clearly needed;   —reaching consensus on the meaning of necessary diagnostic terms that have     been used inconsistently, and avoiding the use of terms that have outlived     their usefulness;   —consistency with data from research studies bearing on the validity of     diagnostic categories;                                                        introduction 3    —suitability for describing subjects in research studies;   —being responsive during the development of dsm-iii to critiques by clini    cians and researchers.     ',\n",
       "  'the major job of the task force has been to determine the most effective strategies for ensuring that the final document attained each goal to as great an extent as possible without compromising the other goals. ',\n",
       "  'thus, the task force evaluated all proposals for changes in dsm-iii that might affect the attainment of these goals. ',\n",
       "  'these proposals came from members of the task force, advisory committees, liaison committees with professional organizations, and participants in the dsm-iii field trials. ',\n",
       "  'finally, the task force reviewed drafts of the text and diagnostic criteria.     ',\n",
       "  'in attempting to resolve various diagnostic issues, the task force relied, as much as possible, on research evidence relevant to various kinds of diagnostic validity. ',\n",
       "  'for example, when discussing a problematic diagnostic category, the task force considered how the disorder, if defined as proposed, provided information relevant to treatment planning, course, and familial pattern. ',\n",
       "  'it should come as no surprise to the reader that even when data were available from relevant research studies, task force members often differed in their interpretations of the findings.      ',\n",

       "  'successive drafts of dsm-iii were prepared by fourteen advisory committees composed of individuals with special expertise in each substantive area. ',\n",

       "  'in addition, in the fall of 1978 the council held an all-day meeting at which some apa members voiced concerns about certain aspects of dsm-iii. ',\n",

       "  'this committee received correspondence on major issues, reviewed successive drafts of dsm-iii, and met a number of times with the chairperson of the task force. ',\n",
       "  'on several occasions the assembly liaison committee arranged for the chairperson of the task force to discuss a particular controversial issue with the entire assembly. ',\n",

',\n",

       "  'the process of development of dsm-iii in may 1975, at a special session of the annual meeting of the apa, an initial draft of the dsm-iii classification was presented. ',\n",
       "  'at each subsequent annual meeting a special session was held on some aspect of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, a special conference was held in st. louis, missouri, in june 1976, to examine \"dsm-iii in midstream.\" this conference, co-sponsored by the missouri institute of psychiatry and the american psychiatric association, was attended by approximately 100 professionals with expertise or special interests in various aspects of dsm-iii, most of whom had previously had no direct involvement in the development of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'as a result of discussions at this conference, additional diagnostic categories were added, some were deleted, and a decision was made to proceed with the development of the multiaxial system.     ',\n",
       "  'the dsm-iii classification and the rationale for the strategies used in its development have been presented throughout the past four years at local, national, and international professional meetings. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, the 4/15/77 draft and successive drafts of dsm-iii have been available to the profession for critical review. ',\n",
       "  'throughout this period there has been continual consideration of various solutions to difficult diagnostic problems, often based on summaries of actual cases submitted to the task force from all quarters. ',\n",

       "  'field trials. ',\n",
       "  'in the past, new classifications of mental disorders have not been extensively subjected to clinical trials before official adoption. ',\n",
       "  'the task force believed that field trials using drafts of dsm-iii should be conducted during the development process to identify problem areas in the classification and to try out solutions to these problems. ',\n",
       "  'in addition, because of the many proposed changes in the classification, it was important to demonstrate its clini                                                       introduction 5  cal acceptability and usefulness in a variety of settings by clinicians of varying theoretical orientations.     ',\n",
       "  'for these reasons, a series of field trials was conducted, beginning in 1977 and culminating in a two year nimh-sponsored field trial from september 1977 to september 1979. ',\n",
       "  'in all, 12,667 patients were evaluated by approximately 550 clinicians, 474 of whom were in 212 different facilities, using successive drafts of dsm-iii. ',\n",
       "  'critiques of all portions of dsm-iii by the field trial participants resulted in numerous changes, as did reviews of case summaries submitted by those participants. ',\n",
       "  'frequently, participants completed questionnaires regarding specific diagnostic issues and their attitudes toward dsm-iii and its innovative features. ',\n",
       "  'the results indicated that the great majority of participants, regardless of theoretical orientations, had a favorable response to dsm-iii.     ',\n",
       "  'perhaps the most important part of the study was the evaluation of diagnostic reliability by having pairs of clinicians make independent diagnostic judgments of several hundred patients. ',\n",
       "  'the results, which are presented in an appendix, generally indicate far greater reliability than had previously been obtained with dsm-ii.      ',\n",

       "  'because of dissatisfaction with icd-9 expressed by organizations representing subspecialties of medicine (not including the american psychiatric association), a decision was made to modify the icd-9 for use in the united states by expanding the four-digit icd-9 codes to five-digit icd-9-cm (for clinical modification) codes whenever greater specificity was required. ',\n",
       "  'this modification was prepared for the united states national center for health statistics by the council on clinical classifications. ',\n",
       "  'the american psychiatric association, in december 1976, was invited to submit recommendations for alternate names and additional categories based on subdivisions of already existing icd-9 categories. ',\n",
       "  'this made it possible for the developing dsm-iii classification and its diagnostic terms to be included in the icd-9-cm classification, which in january 1979 became the official system in this country for recording all \"diseases, injuries, impairments, symptoms, and causes of death.\" the icd9-cm codes and diagnostic terms for mental disorders are included in appendix ',\n",

       "  '(also true for such concepts as physical disorder and   6 introduction  mental and physical health). ',\n",
       "  'nevertheless, it is useful to present concepts that have influenced the decision to include certain conditions in dsm-iii as mental disorders and to exclude others.     ',\n",
       "  'in dsm-iii each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is typically associated with either a painful symptom ',\n",

       "  'or impairment in one or more important areas of functioning ',\n",
       "  '(disability). ',\n",
       "  'in addition, there is an inference that there is a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction, and that the disturbance is not only in the relationship between the individual and society. ',\n",
       "  '(when the disturbance is limited to a conflict between an individual and society, this may represent social deviance, which may or may not be commendable, but is not by itself a mental disorder.)     ',\n",

       "  'a common misconception is that a classification of mental disorders classifies individuals, when actually what are being classified are disorders that individuals have. ',\n",
       "  'for this reason, the text of dsm-iii avoids the use of such phrases as \"a schizophrenic\" or \"an alcoholic,\" and instead uses the more accurate, but admittedly more wordy \"an individual with schizophrenia\" or \"an individual with alcohol dependence.\"     another misconception is that all individuals described as having the same mental disorder are alike in all important ways. ',\n",
       "  'although all the individuals described as having the same mental disorder show at least the defining features  of the disorder, they may well differ in other important ways that may affect clinical management and outcome.      ',\n",
